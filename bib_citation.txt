I'm pleased that you have found benefit from my archive.

As to bibliographic style, there is probably not yet a universal
way to cite things on the Internet, but here are my thoughts.

I would prefer not to cite separate URLs of individual articles,
because these are subject to change.  I do intend to keep the main
entry URL for the collection valid, as long as the University of
Tennessee will give me disk space and HTTP service.  (I hope to
keep at least an indirection link there, even if someday the
bulk of the collection moves elsewhere.)

Most of my collection consists of articles that someone else wrote and
posted to Usenet. Therefore, in the bibliographic sense, I am the
editor or redactor.  So let me propose this citation format:


    Doupnik, J. D. "Re: reverse video behavior in VT320." Usenet:
    comp.terminals, <56$opnw@netlab.usu.edu>, 17 May 1993.
    In "Video Terminal Information" archive, R. S. Shuford, ed.,
    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html.


Scattered through the collection are bits of text that I wrote as
an update, or to clarify something, or just to fill in where Usenet
was silent.  Some of these blurbs may be identified by my initials
"...RSS" at the end, but I may possibly have omitted it somewhere.
In these cases, if the page has a title at the top, use that to cite it.
If you used anything that has no title, tell me and I'll assign a title
to it.  (The Web gives the publisher great flexibility, nicht wahr?)

    Shuford. R.S. "Datamedia." In "Video Terminal Information" archive,
    R. S. Shuford, ed., http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html.
