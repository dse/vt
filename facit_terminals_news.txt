I have two terminals (glass-terminals), both FACIT without any docs.
One has the screen mounted on a L-shaped stand and it can be rotated
to either landscape or portrait-mode, the other has a rather heavy
keyboard and some kind of video-connector on the backside.  Do anyone
know anything or have docs about these?

FACIT was a Swedish manufacturer of various office equipment including
calculators, typewriters, diverse terminals, even computers, for those who
didn't know that.

This would be a FACIT TWIST. Basically VT100 compatible, but can also work
in a 'proprietary' mode. Support hardware flow control. Should have a very
nice high-resolution paper-white and almost flicker-free display. Displays
24 lines of 80 characters each (standard VT100 size) in landscape mode
with nice large characters, and _72_ lines at 80 characters in portrait
mode (i.e., a full page of typed text). I had one of these myself and
loved it :) But it has now found a different (better?) home.

Are you certain that this is a _terminal_ and not a computer? Does it have
any markings?

It is the screen that has the video-connector,
mod 4431.

When I first powerd it up, the screen was flickering bad, but it got
better after some time, but then the CRT just died, I was fiddleing
with the setup and changed 60/50Hz mode to 50Hz, what I have, what is
this setting for? it is in the "software"-setup together with
line-speed an parity.

        Hey!  Hacker!  Leave those lists alone!

Nah, a LOT of TTL is when you've got 7 or so boards of it.  I had a tossed
terminal like that once.  Was a REALLY dumb terminal (what a surprise). 
Didn't work either, could never get it to play nice with my modem.  No
microprocessor in it at all.  Had like 7 boards covered with chips.  Real
cool.  Of course, I tossed it :(

Kan det funka att ge den ett 'break'  (^U)  ?
startar terminalen alltid upp i 19200?
