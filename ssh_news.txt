In practice, most implementations of the telnet protocol do not contain
an encryption mechanism for passwords.  Some simple needs for security
can be satisfied by an SSH "secure shell" connection.  However, any
enterprise requiring large communication deployments probably needs
a more heavy-duty technology.  (One question of interest may be this:
"If an evil-doer steals a notebook computer containing all of a user's
SSH authentication keys, and starts using them, what do we do?"

One well known and widely available security technology is Kerberos,
which was developed at MIT in concert with a consortium of vendors. 
Centralized administration of access is easier with Kerberos than with
the individualistic SSH protocol.  See:

    "Kerberos Page"
    http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/

Sun Microsystems provides a full Kerberos implementation in its SEAM
(Sun Enterprise Authentication Mechanism) package for Solaris 8 and 9. 
It interoperates OK with Microsoft Windows 2000.

    http://wwws.sun.com/software/download/security.html
    http://wwws.sun.com/software/security/kerberos/ 

Hewlett-Packard has Kerberos software for OpenVMS and for HP-UX:

    http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/operating/security/index.html#system
    http://h71000.www7.hp.com/openvms/products/kerberos/

IBM has Kerberos implementations for several of its product lines:

But perhaps SSH is appropriate for your use.

Alas, during 2002, a vulnerability was found in certain releases of the
OpenSSH package.  See:

Sun's Solaris 9 operating environment incorporated a Sun-supported package
"Secure Shell" on CD 1, which is based on release 2.5.1p1 of OpenSSH; the
version shipped with Solaris 9 (SSH-2.0_Sun_SSH_1.0) included enhancements
made by Sun.  Sun added BSM (auditing) support, proxy commands, L10N/I18N
support, and configurable login attempts. Also, TCP wrappers were compiled
and the ssh-keygen command was set to create an RSA key by default.

    http://wwws.sun.com/software/whitepapers/solaris9/secureaccess.pdf
    http://docs.sun.com/?q=ssh&p=prod%2Fsolaris.9

For earlier Solaris releases, Sun does not support any SSH product;
however, the third-party SSH product is available with support from 
SSH Communications Security Oyj. of Finland:

    http://www.ssh.fi/

There is also the open-source OpenSSH.  The following BluePrint documents
tell how to configure OpenSSH under Solaris 2.6, Solaris 7, and Solaris 8.

    http://www.sun.com/blueprints/0103/817-1307.pdf
    http://www.sun.com/blueprints/0701/openSSH.pdf
    http://www.sun.com/blueprints/0102/configssh.pdf

And advice is available from other non-Sun sources:

    http://www.bolthole.com/solaris/companioncd.html
    http://www.sunfreeware.com/openssh8.html

Sun's BSM patches have been donated back to the OpenSSH developers:

    http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2

If, using Solaris 9's Secure Shell to connect to commercial SSH, you see a
session error like "Dispatch protocol error: type 2", you are experiencing
a problem inherited from the original open-source code.  Until a fix is
announced by Sun, see:

    http://www.openssh.com/faq.html#2.4

For enterprises that wish to lift the burden of security configuration from
the individual users and rely more on a centralized support staff, IPsec
should be preferred over Secure Shell:

    http://wwws.sun.com/software/whitepapers/solaris9/ipsec.pdf

IPsec provides security at the Network layer, rather than in the
Transport layer.  IPsec passes UDP packets, which SSH does not,
and IPsec may be used to construct VPNs between consenting equipment.

    #

 ..............................................................................

If, during connection attempts using the OpenSSH client, you are seeing
an error message like this:

    no matching comp found: client zlib server none

you may be able to work around the problem by turning off compression in
the session.  Compression may be configured to a default of "no" in either

    /etc/ssh_config
or
    ~/.ssh/config

Compression may be turned back on for a given connection with the command-line
switch of "-C" (uppercase).

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What most people call the "SFTP" protocol, as in "Secure FTP", is
a file-transfer shim laid over the Secure Shell protocol--the same
fundamental SSH protocol that most people now use for interactive
keyboard sessions instead of good old telnet.  Both SSH interactive
sessions and SFTP file-transfer sessions operate over TCP port 22.

Another protocol of similar intent, if not as wide use, is 
"FTP over TLS/SSL", on TCP ports 989 (data) and 990 (control). 

I think that the OpenBSD Project claims to have produced the open-source
"sftp" program.  Here is the client "man" page:

    http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp&sektion=1

See also "sftp-server" man page:

    http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp-server&sektion=8

Cygwin produced an equivalent command-line SFTP.EXE program for Windows:

    http://www.cygwin.com/

Yes, PuTTY fans, Simon Tatham includes a basic PSFTP utility for Windows.

OK, thank you for pointing this out.  The target environment
does not presently require X forwarding, but to prevent future
difficulties, logging will be this way:

With the following in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

    # Syslog facility and level
    SyslogFacility auth
    LogLevel info
 
inserting the following line into /etc/syslog.conf:
    
    auth.info      /var/adm/auth.log
      
doing:
    
    # touch /var/adm/auth.log
    # chgrp sys /var/adm/auth.log
    # chmod 644 /var/adm/auth.log
    
and doing:
  
    # /etc/init.d/syslog stop
    # /etc/init.d/syslog start

Subject: Bare bones ssh for Windows

Windows comes with an application named telnet that does a fair
job of emulating a terminal, but a very poor job of securing a
session. In fact, only a fool would use telnet in today's hostile
networked world.

Instead, most people use secure shell (ssh) to provide encrypted
telnet sessions that keep prying eyes at bay. Unfortunately,
Microsoft does not yet bundle ssh with Windows. They leave it up
to you to find your own ssh app for Windows.

Lots of ssh apps exist, but, from my perspective, they do ugly
things like sparsely install files all over a file system, muck
with the registry, and upgrade Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

I like to keep things simple by using a command line unix / MSDOS
installation methodology that consists of creating a parent
directory then copying files under it.

cygwin ( http://www.cygwin.com/ ) allows you to run traditional,
open source, unix applications under Windows. You need to install
it along with ssh to obtain the necessary files that we use in
our bare bones cygwin ssh.

After you install cygwin with ssh you need to locate the
following files and copy them into a parent directory:

    CYGCRYPTO.DLL
    CYGWIN1.DLL
    CYGZ.DLL
    SCP.EXE
    SFTP.EXE
    SSH.EXE
    SSH-ADD.EXE
    SSH-AGENT.EXE
    SSH-KEYGEN.EXE
    SSH-KEYSCAN.EXE

You only need to copy those files to install ssh (and a couple
of handy, secure file copying programs named scp and sftp) into
any Windows PC. If you want, you can even remove cygwin from the
PC that you originally used to obtain the files.

Those files fit on a pair of 3.5" diskettes. I always keep a pair
handy in the field in case I need to use a Windows PC to download
software from my server.

An example of how to use scp:

   scp -S ./ssh mach@192.168.1.1:data .

In the example, a user named mach wants to copy a file named data
from mach's home directory on a server with an IP address of
192.168.1.1 to the current directory of Windows.

You need to enter the -S argument to explicitly specify the path
to the ssh binary otherwise scp defaults to a path of usr/bin.
Notice that the -S argument uses forward slashes in place of the
reverse slashes typically found in Windows.

PuTTY would be yet easier, as it only consists of one executable
which nicely fits on a single floppy. No need to fool around with
cygwin, either.

Okay, as I have an interest in this I'll bite.

CRT 3.4.3
  2.4 Mb Includes a windows installer.

PuTTY
  400k Bare exe only needed. Other tools, agent, keygen, psftp etc are
  around 200k each. Total 1.2Mb.

PuTTY provides full source code, CRT is binaries only.
  Source code is, approx, another 400k.

PuTTY has better emulation.
  CRT doesn't 'eat' all VTxxx sequences that it doesn't support.
  CRT has no support for alternate host character encodings.
  PuTTY can use many different host character encodings including UTF-8
  PuTTY has some support for DBCS character encodings.
  PuTTY has compose key support (on the windows menu key or AltGr)
  PuTTY understands more of the real VT100 codes.
  CRT understands more of the real VT220 codes.
  PuTTY works out of the 'box' as an accurate colour Xterm.
  CRT fails various vttest tests including 'BUG F' and the funny scroll
    regions test, PuTTY does not.

PuTTY has better display
  CRT will only double size it's own font, putty will do any unless
    told not to in which case it will double space.
  CRT can only display VT graphics with it's own font PuTTY can use any
     windows font and even does the 'stepped lines' properly.
  CRT's fullscreen mode either has 'too small' characters or no line
     drawing characters.

CRT has modem and TAPI connectivity PuTTY has only ssh, telnet and rlogin.
CRT can do in channel zmodem file transfers.
CRT has some scripting support PuTTY does not.
CRT has easier selection of emulation, however PuTTY can emulate all the
  terminals CRT can _if_ you set it up.  (In fact PuTTY's Linux terminal
  support actually works, unlike CRT)

CRT's scrollback is limited to 32000 lines, PuTTY's is limited by memory.
CRT has inline printing support.
CRT has a generic keymap editor.

And finally, PuTTY will not let the host overwhelm it.  Eg: cat /dev/zero
will lockup CRT's network module but PuTTY doesn't even notice.

I prefer PuTTY as I don't need the extra features that CRT gives however
before I found and contributed to PuTTY my favorite was CRT (I even _paid_
for a copy!)

    A.10.3 What does "PuTTY" mean?

    It's the name of a popular SSH and Telnet client. Any other meaning
    is in the eye of the beholder. It's been rumoured that "PuTTY" is the
    antonym of "getty", or that it's the stuff that makes your Windows
    useful, or that it's a kind of plutonium Teletype.   We couldn't
    possibly comment on such allegations.

PuTTY itself doesn't do this. PuTTY asks the system for its default
I-beam mouse pointer, and uses whatever it gets.

I've seen the phenomenon you mention myself on NT 4, but I think it's
due to the graphics driver - on other NT 4 boxes the same thing didn't
happen.

The default I-beam mouse pointer is composed of `reverse' pixels, which
are supposed to invert the colour under them, so the pointer should show
up as black when on a white background and white when on a black
background. When I checked carefully on the NT 4 box that had the
problem, the mouse pointer was indeed composed of `reverse' pixels, but
they simply weren't doing their job properly. This is the graphics
driver's fault; the only thing PuTTY does to provoke it is to have a
black background by default.

The only solution I could find (apart from changing my graphics driver)
was to design myself a fixed-colour mouse pointer, with a white I-beam
surrounded by a black outline so it would be visible everywhere.
Installing that in place of the standard I-beam solved my problem,
though it looked a bit ugly on white backgrounds.

Agreed - if you just want a Win* ssh client, PuTTY looks like
the better choice.

That said, one of the primary objectives in my original article 
was to explore the minimal installation required for cygwin. My 
research provided the following info:

1. You only need CYGWIN1.DLL to run an app compiled for
   cygwin, unless the app itself relies upon other
   package. (i.e. SSH relies upon the gzip and crypto
   packages, which means you also need CYGCRYPTO.DLL and
   CYGZ.DLL in order to run SSH.EXE.)

2. You DO NOT need to use a cygwin bash shell to invoke
   an app.

3. Although cygwin's bash shell app updates the Win*
   registry, you can invoke cygwin apps directly and
   they leave the registry alone.
 
Granted, those points may seem intuitively obvious to smarter
people. ;)

> You can find PuTTY (which is open source and free to download)
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^

I *demand* open source these days. When I fiddled with PuTTY a 
few years ago, I overlooked its open source.

Here's my reasons for continuing to use cygwin's ssh:

1) Both unix and Win* ssh use the same source. I like to make
   open source apps do double duty in the unix and Win* worlds
   whenever possible. It helps me keep my sanity. :)

2) My perception that ssh enjoys a wider, more diverse user
   base that may allow bugs to surface faster to ensure a
   robust app.

Yes.

From a Command Prompt (DOS window) on your old computer, run:

   REGEDIT /EA  putty.reg HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY

Copy the putty.reg file this creates to your new computer.  Find that
file on your new computer in Explorer and double-click it.  This
should import all your PuTTY saved sessions on the new computer.

This is great news! I've had both TeraTerm and Putty on all of my
Intel machines, so I can do serial connections (from TeraTerm),
and SSH2 (from Putty). Now I can eliminate one.

Thanks Boris, and thanks to Yutaka as well.

Have you tried using UTF-8 translation in PuTTY? See my recent posting 
<http://groups.google.com/groups?q=msgid%3AXtD%2ARtLCp%40news.chiark.greenend.org.uk>.

This is turning into an FAQ for us, so please reply or mail
putty@projects.tartarus.org if you resolve this issue.

If RH8 has switched to expecting a UTF-8 terminal by default, I'm not
sure what the right solution is -- for the RH system to send an
appropriate escape code at some point, or to expect users to switch
PuTTY into UTF-8 mode, or what.

This is nothing to do with SSH, but never mind:

What you should do depends on your software. The way it works is that
when PuTTY sees a particular escape sequence, it starts directing all
received data to a printer instead of the screen (another sequence
turns this off).

There is a C program called 'lpansi' floating around which will do
this -- Google for it.

You need to arrange that the server sends printer data in the
appropriate format (PostScript, PCL, etc). The configuration in PuTTY
is simply to route the raw data to the right place.

Subject: SECURITY UPDATE: PuTTY version 0.56 is released

SECURITY UPDATE: PuTTY version 0.56 is released
-----------------------------------------------

All the pre-built binaries, and the source code, are now available
from the PuTTY website at

    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

This is a SECURITY UPDATE. We recommend that _everybody_ upgrade, as
soon as possible.

This version fixes a security hole in previous versions of PuTTY,
which can allow an SSH2 server to attack your client before host key
verification. This means that you are not even safe if you trust the
server you _think_ you're connecting to, since it could be spoofed
over the network and the host key check would not detect this before
the attack could take place. The attack can allow the server to
execute code of its choice on the client.

This vulnerability was found by iDEFENSE, who we expect to release
an advisory on the subject shortly.

In addition to this security fix, there have been some other bug
fixes and new features. Notable among them are:

 - Ability to restart a session within an inactive window, via a new
   menu option.

 - Minimal support for not running a shell or command at all in SSH
   protocol 2 (equivalent to OpenSSH's `-N' option). PuTTY/Plink
   still provide a normal window for interaction, and have to be
   explicitly killed.

 - Transparent support for CHAP cryptographic authentication in the
   SOCKS 5 proxy protocol. (Not in PuTTYtel.)

 - More diagnostics in the Event Log, particularly of SSH port
   forwarding.

 - Ability to request setting of environment variables in SSH
   (protocol 2 only). (However, we don't know of any _servers_ that
   support this.)

 - Ability to send POSIX signals in SSH (protocol 2 only) via the
   `Special Commands' menu. (Again, we don't know of any servers
   supporting this.)

 - Bug fix: The PuTTY tools now more consistently support usernames
   containing `@' signs.

 - Support for the Polish character set `Mazovia'.

 - When logging is enabled, the log file is flushed more frequently,
   so that its contents can be viewed before it is closed.

 - More flexibility in SSH packet logging: known passwords and
   session data can be omitted from the log file. Passwords are
   omitted by default. (This option isn't perfect for removing
   sensitive details; you should still review log files before
   letting them out of your sight.)

 - Unix-specific changes:
    * Ability to set environment variables in pterm.
    * PuTTY and pterm attempt to use a UTF-8 line character set by
      default if this is indicated by the locale; however, this can
      be overridden.

 - Various minor bug fixes and robustness improvements.

I repeat: PuTTY 0.56 fixes a SERIOUS SECURITY HOLE in all previous
versions of PuTTY. You should upgrade now.

Enjoy using PuTTY!

Cheers,
Simon

All the pre-built binaries, and the source code, are now available
from the PuTTY website at

    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

This is a SECURITY UPDATE. We recommend that _everybody_ upgrade, as
soon as possible.

This version fixes a security hole in previous versions of PuTTY,
which can allow a malicious SFTP server to attack your client. If
you use either PSCP or PSFTP, you should upgrade. Users of the main
PuTTY program are not affected. (However, note that the server must
have passed host key verification before this attack can be
launched, so a man-in-the-middle shouldn't be able to attack you if
you're careful.)

This vulnerability was found by iDEFENSE, who we expect to release
an advisory on the subject shortly.

In addition to this security patch, there are also a few very minor
bug fixes which should stop PuTTY from crashing in circumstances
involving port forwarding, or failing to correctly perform X
forwarding. Other than that, though, 0.57 is almost identical to the
previous release 0.56.

I repeat: PuTTY 0.57 fixes a SERIOUS SECURITY HOLE in many previous
versions of PSCP and PSFTP. If you use either of those programs, you
should upgrade now.

Enjoy using PuTTY!

Subject: PuTTY version 0.59 is released

I haven't posted PuTTY release announcements here in the past, but I
thought this one might be of interest to at least some people on this
group, owing to the new serial-port functionality.

My current intention is that this posting should be a one-off; but if
consensus on this newsgroup is that I should post here about all PuTTY
releases in future, then I will. (And conversely, if consensus is that
I shouldn't even have posted this one, I'll apologise.)

PuTTY version 0.59 is released
------------------------------

All the pre-built binaries, and the source code, are now available
from the PuTTY website at

    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

New features in this release include:

 - PuTTY can now connect to a local serial port, as an alternative
   to making a network connection.

 - Windows PuTTY now has the same local proxy support as Unix PuTTY
   (equivalent to OpenSSH's `ProxyCommand' option), allowing network
   connections to be managed by a separate proxy program of your
   choice. Plink also has a new `-nc' mode which makes it a useful
   local proxy command.

 - The manual is now provided in HTMLHelp format as well as
   old-style WinHelp, meaning that online help will be available on
   Windows Vista.

 - Support for password expiry in SSH-2.

 - Various performance improvements and cryptography upgrades.

Bug fixes in this release include:

 - PuTTY should now run on all variants of Windows XP, without
   giving the `application configuration is incorrect' error.

 - The file transfer utilities PSCP and PSFTP now support files
   bigger than 2Gb (provided the underlying operating system does
   too).

 - Font linking (the automatic use of other fonts on the system to
   provide Unicode characters not present in the selected one)
   should now work again on Windows, after being broken in 0.58.

 - On Windows, the random seed file PUTTY.RND should now be stored
   in a more sensible place by default.

 - IPv6 should now work in Windows Vista as well as earlier versions
   of Windows.

 - Numerous other small bug fixes.


Enjoy using PuTTY!

Yes, there was a very embarrassing bug in the release. 

The development snapshots should have it fixed, and we hope to put out
a bug-fix release reasonably soon.

(It's very annoying: a bug like that _should_ by rights have caused
a crash every time, but for some reason it never crashed for me, in

PuTTY version 0.60 is released
------------------------------

All the pre-built binaries, and the source code, are now available
from the PuTTY website at

    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

This is a minor patch release to 0.59; it contains only bug fixes,
and only very minor new features. New features include:

 - Pressing Ctrl+Break now sends a serial break signal in the serial
   back end, and in the SSH and Telnet backends it asks the server
   to do the same (if the server supports it). The previous
   Ctrl+Break behaviour can still be triggered with Ctrl-C.

 - On Windows, it is no longer necessary to configure high-numbered
   serial lines such as COM10 as `\\.\COM10'; PuTTY does this
   automatically.

 - You can now store a host name in the Default Settings.

Bug fixes include:

 - Embarrassingly, both of the major new features in 0.59 (serial
   support and local proxy support) caused frequent crashes on many
   Windows machines. We didn't notice this because for some reason
   they never crashed for us in months of testing!

 - In 0.59, it was possible to lock yourself out of the configuration
   dialog by configuring a serial connection in Default Settings. This
   should no longer be possible.

 - We've had reports of the error message `Unable to read from
   standard input' in Plink 0.59. We've found and fixed one cause of
   this message, and added better diagnostics in case there are
   others.

 - 0.59 could emit malformed SSH-2 packets that upset some servers
   (such as Foundry routers). Fixed.

 - Other minor bug fixes.

Enjoy using PuTTY!

Before Ctrl+Break sent a serial break, it was a synonym for Ctrl+C.
So you should still be able to use Ctrl+C for anything you'd
previously have done with Ctrl+Break.

PuTTY stores settings in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive of the Registry,
so each individual Windows user will have his own PuTTY settings.

This works even when PuTTY is running on a Windows Terminal Server
or Citrix server.

PuTTY doesn't directly support this.

However, it does support a "local proxy" where input/output come from a
process' standard input / output.

http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/puttydoc/Chapter4.html#config-proxy

If you can find a command which will connect that to a Unix domain
socket / named pipe, you should be fine.

0.58 supports this on Unix, but on Windows you'll need a recent
development snapshot for local proxy support.

It is hard to find a tool to attech a named pipe to telnet connection
or STDIO for windows.

As the serial backend is done, I think UNIX domain socket / named pipe
can be easily done by modify the serial backend a bit.

    named pipe example:
    http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365592.aspx

    UNIX domain socket example:

Anyone can make a TCP connection to port 6000 and speak X.
Whether that gets them anywhere depends.

If you have done 'xhost +' they *can* use your display which includes
capturing your keystokes. You could disable xhost authentication and
then they would have to somehow steal your magic cookie to gain access.

In any case, if you use ssh with X forwarding, there is no need to have
the X server listen on 6000. If your particular X server has the option
of not listening then use this, otherwise use IP filtering to block
external access to pot 6000 if you are worried.

I suspect SSH (OpenSSH at least) uses SSL library for encryption
anyway, so you won't see any noticeable difference. (Of course,
if SSH protocol was designed properly, they'd leave encryption
to SSL in the first place.)

FWIW, when OpenSSH folks dropped the cipher=none option I did a
few tests on large-ish files. Size increase was below 1% and
transfer time increase was below the resoluton of time command.

It may be that TeraTermSSH only supports Protocol 1.    [yes]

Most SSH is shipping now  with it disabled as it is considered less secure.

Check sshd.config for a line  that should look like:

        Protocol 2,1

That line says negotiate for Protocol 2 first but if the client is unable 
fallback to Protocol 1.

I was able to get both j2ssh and mindterm to port easily, but I was
running into display problems.  I tried jsch, and integrated it fairly
easily, but I encounter the same display problems; namely running a
script that calls an executable produces output from the script, but
not from the executable *until* the executable finishes, at which
point all output is then displayed.  It accepts input just fine.

See my post in comp.security.ssh for details.  Thanks for the
suggestion.

Subject: Can't see output in SSH

I am having problems with seeing output from a program using SSH.

I need to pass in a script to execute.  Inside the script, an
executable program is called, which starts up an interactive
data-entry session with the user (display question, read input, rinse,
repeat).

If I use putty from the command line without calling the script, I get
my prompt, and can run the script and see the program execute just
fine.  But if I pass in a command file with the script in it, the
script still executes, it displays output from the script just fine,
and runs the executable, but the output from the executable is not
displayed on my screen immediately.

It can still accept input.. I can I can respond to prompts I know are
there, and it will accept and respond to my keystrokes.. but I never
see the output, UNTIL the executable finishes, as which point all the
output that it produced flashes briefly in the window before the
window closes.

I am seeing identical behavior using MindTerm's SSH java client which
I have integrated into a java application.  The window comes up and
displays shell output fine, but the executable's output isn't shown
until it's in the process of closing the window when it completes.

Again, with either putty or mindterm, if I don't pass in the command
to execute, I get my UNIX prompt, and I can type in the command to
start the script, and I see and can interact with the executable just
fine.  It's only when I pass in the script to run that I can't see the
executable's output.

What am I missing?  I need to have this dynamic; having to type in the
command at the prompt each time is not an option.  Please help!

my putty command line that works but I have to type in the command:

c:\putty.exe.lnk -ssh -t -l <user> -pw <pw> -2 <host>

The other one I tried that won't display the executable output:

c:\putty.exe.lnk -ssh -t -l <user> -pw <pw> -2 -m c:\cmdfile <host>
where "c:\cmdfile" is a text file containing the path to the UNIX
script to run.

I'd much rather use MindTerm since I've already integrated the
BasicClient into my application, as I don't really want to have 50
different "cmdfile"s on my drive for the many different commands I
will be running, so though I appreciate any help on either putty or
mindterm, information to help me get mindterm working would be
awesome.

Thanks!

Subject: PuTTY GUI as windows cmd.exe replacement

Hi everyone,

Did anyone ever try to replace the PuTTY core, and just try to execute
cmd.exe instead.

I really dislike working with the command prompt, although sometimes I
have to. This is in complete contrast to the PuTTY GUI, which I find
very easy to work with.

So I was thinking about taking out the bulk of the PuTTY core, and
replacing it a call to cmd.exe. Hopefully cmd will detect it already
has a window, and not try to create on of it's own.
Did anyone try this in the past? With any success? Where can I get it?
(getting ahead of myself, as I don't see I'll have time to try to do
this myself in the near future)

Thanks,
Ron

The upshot of which is that it looks like Windows doesn't have Unix-like
pseudo-terminals, and just running cmd.exe in a pair of pipes loses you
command-line editing.

Confusingly, some people use the phrase `escape sequence' to mean
the commands you (as the user) can send into OpenSSH by typing ~ as
the first character of a new line. So it's possible that the
original poster didn't mean it in the same way you (and I) would
naturally use the phrase.

> So, I assume it can't be done, and will never be implemented.

If your interpretation is correct, then you're quite right; having
PuTTY able to modify its port forwarding setup in response to output
sent by the server would be a major security misfeature.

However, if the original poster merely wants a way to reconfigure
port forwardings in mid-session from the client end, that is
something I do want to do:

SSH encryption of X connections via X11Forwarding creates a tunnel to carry
such traffic safely, point-to-point, instead of exposing your local machine
to the world.

What you ve done is to completely open your local X server to remote
manipulation by anyone who can reach your machine from elsewhere in your
network, and depending on your configuratiion anywhere in the world. This
can include some very nasty vulnerabilities, and some amusing ones. When I
caught someone doing that at an old workplace, despite my repeated warnings
about it and explanations of how to use SSH X11 forwarding, I ran the
"xroach" program on their unsecured display without their knowledge while
they were away at lunch.

The screams when they moved a window and the roaches popped out from under
it and ran around the screen were *prize*, followed by the shaky laughter
when they figured out what had happened, and I showed them how to *splat*
the roaches with the mouse. It did make my point, and they stopped doing
that.

You haven't stated precisely what your problem is.

On experimenting, I find (with a Debian potato server) that checking
"Disable Application Keypad Mode" in PuTTY (on the Features panel)
allows me to use the keypad in MC in both cursor-keys-etc and numeric
mode, switching with Num Lock.

Without this, Num Lock acts as a function key (causing help to be
invoked as if F1 were typed), so only the cursor-keys mode is accessible.
It's possible that this may break other apps though--try it and see.

Thanks guys.

Simon: That works. I configured Putty to open the system menu on ALT-Space,
so I just have to program down-arrow clicks to get to "minimize" and then
click "return." I'm glad that worked because there's no way to use sendkeys
to click the Windows icon key, and I don't want to learn C just for this.

Subject: Putty Keyboard Problem - Shift Tab

Hey folks,

I have been investigating a small issue that I have with Putty 0.60
since I started using it for my ssh/telnet sessions.
Been playing around with a lot of settings to find a solution, but no
luck yet ...

Using putty to connect to linux machines via ssh e.g. I am of course in
need of auto completion on the linux shell.

Basically auto completion works, except for when you hold down the shift
key while pressing TAB to autocomplete.

Other terminal clients can do this just fine, e.g. Teraterm or
Cygwin/rxvt. No problems there with using shift-tab.

I really can't imagine that no one ran into that "problem" before. But
it's hard to find any comments regarding this issue with putty on the web.

Especially when you have a lot of Upper-Case only files or directories,
that you want to auto complete with TAB this can get very annoying,
since you type the first few letters of the directory e.g. while holding
down shift, and usually don't let it go when pressing TAB to complete it.
Maybe someone here can help me with this. Putty gives me everything I
need from a terminal client. Finding a solution to this would be great.

thanks,

Thorsten

It isn't at all clear from your report - you should make a habit of
stating precisely what you see and also explicitly stating what you
expected to see - but it _sounds_ as if you're expecting Shift+Tab
to do exactly the same thing as just pressing Tab without Shift. Is
that right?

PuTTY deliberately doesn't do this, because users _requested_ that I
turn Shift+Tab into a distinguishable control sequence, so that
applications which were displaying on-screen forms could use Tab to
move through the form fields in one order and Shift-Tab to move
through them in the reverse order, as you'd expect from the
equivalent form interface in environments like the Windows GUI.

The unavoidable effect of this is that Tab and Shift-Tab must send
different control sequences to the server, otherwise such an
application wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

A simple solution at your end would be to reconfigure your readline
settings so that PuTTY's control sequence for Shift-Tab (ESC [ Z) is
treated the same way as the sequence for Tab (equivalent to Ctrl-I).
For instance, in bash, you could write

  bind '"\e[Z": complete'

or, as a more global approach (which would benefit all readline-
using applications instead of just bash, since things like gdb also
use completion) you could add the line

  "\e[Z": complete

to ~/.inputrc.

Hi Simon,

sorry if I didn't explain the problem clear enough, but I think you got
what I meant ...

Your explanation makes sense to me. I will try to use your workaround
and do the respective bindings on one of my shells.

Thanks a lot for your support.

Xterm 227 can output CSI 27;5;9~ for Ctrl+Tab, if the
modifyOtherKeys resource is 1 or 2.  If one made Putty imitate
that, it would have at least some chance of being recognized by
existing applications.

Subject: Re: Terminal settings required to transmit ctrl+tab sequence

Greetings,

> the aforementioned sequences as key bindings for tab navigation in vim

I'm looking for this too. Have you made any progress?

Like F. Lucado says, PuTTY is probably capturing Ctrl-Tab for its own
purposes and/or not passing it along. I don't see anything in its
configuration dialog. We would probably have to track this down in the
source.

Here's a reference to someone else capturing Ctrl-Tab for their own
custom version of PuTTY:

    http://www.stansell.org/tools/putty/

This makes me think that Ctrl-Tab is not used by PuTTY proper.

I've done some grepping in the source but am not seeing anything obvious
(my first time in this codebase though, lots of orientation happening).
I see a PK_TAB constant defined in putty.h that is used in terminal.c.
In general, it looks like all of the terminal emulation is done in that
file, and the unix, windows, and mac/macosx subdirectories are only for
the various GUIs.

I searched for "tab" in the Wishlist, Change Log, and FAQ, and came up
empty (although in the Change Log I did see a reference to Shift-Tab
support being added "[b]y popular demand.") At this point I think it's
safe to email the developers (putty@projects.tartarus.org), and I'll
do so if you haven't figured this out already.

PuTTY doesn't act on CTRL+TAB.

Unfortunately it didn't work.

I uninstalled the package from

    http://lexa.mckenna.edu/sshwindows/

and in place of that I installed  the cygwin OpenSSH stuff.
And now it works pretty fine.

I don't know, but maybe that coheres with my Windows XP,
I also tested OpenSSH from 

    http://lexa.mckenna.edu/sshwindows/

on my Windows 2000 machine and there it works out of the box.

Anyhow, problem solved.

SSH = encrypted
Telnet = plaintext

To see this in action, sit on a network where you can run a packet 
sniffer... log into a machine using telnet (observe your password in the 
clear), and then the same with ssh...

Telnet runs on TCP port 23, SSH on TCP port 22 for your filtering 
pleasures...

When in doubt, USE SSH!!!.. and not SSHv1...

There are ways of configuring your authentication methods.. this is 
generally a server-side thing, so you may or may not have access to this..

In either event, once your session has been established (even before the 
password is sent), your communication is secured...

For more fun, ssh someplace with the -v (for verbose) switch to ssh... 

this will show the handshake protocol in gory detail.. :)

Enjoy..

Why not just specify the connection timeout?

Note that -q turns off messages, but it does not prevent the client from
asking necessary interactive questions...  You'd need BatchMode for that.

ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=2 /bin/true > /dev/null

You could fork a program that would kill the process in 2 seconds.  If
it exits, then the kill will just not work.

Something like this.  There might be some tweaking needed.

LOOP..
...
ssh -o BatchMode=yes $host /bin/true > /dev/null &
SSH_PID=$!
(sleep 2 ; kill $SSH_PID >/dev/null 2>&1)&

STATUS=wait $SSH_PID

...

The wait should block until the ssh exits, either from a normal exit or
because it's killed.

Of course you probably want to upgrade anyway.

Take a look at the options available in the ssh_config file.

One way is to have the restricted key not be in the default identity
file.  Make the automated process reference it explicitly.  (I do this
preferentially)


  ssh -o IdentityFile=auto_backup ... or
  ssh -i auto_backup ...

Another way is to change the attempted authentication methods.

  ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=keyboard-interactive,password ...

Or just disable public key authentication.

  ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no ...

I don't see what's wrong with open negotiation of the method.  Passing keys
in the clear, however, can be a problem.

BTW, were you looking at SSHv1?  SSHv2 fixed MANY of the problems in the
protocol.

You are incorrect.  My commercial product may have restrictions on the
_strength_ of the ciphers involved, but I have no trapdoors or secret
entrances in my particular set of security protocols (IPsec and IKE).
Sure you can access the keys if you are root on the system, but if 
you're root, all bets are off anyway.

If you don't trust the IKE protocol for key exchanges, do manual keying.
In my previous job we used to refer to "keying by Marine guard" as a
valid option.

And now on to the actual previous poster, as opposed to the one two
before...

SSH (both v1 and v2) are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack if operated
in their default modes.  The first time you see a public-key fingerprint for
a remote host, you either have seen it from the server's administrator--out of
band--or are taking it on faith.  I can theoretically intercept your traffic
and rewrite it in both directions, fooling both sides at once.  Only a
trusted third party, or other out-of-band sharing can thwart this.  (There

"Can crack" is obvious. "At what expense" is not, and I'm sure is the

Yes, you will also need to regenerate you host keys in a
supported format that will work with ssh1/ssh2.

I do like this (Solaris 9) in a jumpstart script:

    echo "Solaris ssh v1 +fix"
    /etc/init.d/sshd stop
    rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
    ssh-keygen -t rsa1 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -P ''
    /etc/init.d/sshd start

This isn't really a Solaris question; there's probably a better group

ssh doesn't have a "-r" option, so that's probably not the command used.
The command might be "-R".

-R is documented on the ssh(1) man page.  In short, it says that port
4242 should be opened as a "listen"-type port on the remote machine,
and when any connection is attempted to that port on the remote
machine, a separate connection is made by the local machine to
localhost:22 (the sshd port), and data is tunneled by ssh between the
two.

> I don't understand what's going on with this command correctly.
> I just know that this command is used for forwarding ssh session, etc.

Right.  The remote peer would do something like this:

    ssh -p 4242 someuser@213.22.123.12 ...

The connection would then be forwarded through to localhost:22 by the
ssh session created as you original posted.

While it is good that Yutaka Hirata has lately undertaken to enhance
TeraTerm for SSH2, I've tried the January 2005 "UTF-8 TeraTerm Pro"
release and found it unstable (at least under Windows 98SE on my
home machine).  But I hope he will keep working on it.

There are many terminal-emulation programs available in the world:
some free, and numerous commercial products.  You give no clues
about what kind of organization you belong to, but many enterprises
would be better off with a commercial product where the users can
get technical support by telephone.

In contrast, a free product must give a warning, not a warranty:

    The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
    program is with you.  Should the program prove defective,
    you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or
    correction.

Over the last two years, many vendors of terminal-emulating Telnet
clients have enhanced them to support SSH connectivity; some also
support other secure connection types, notably Kerberos and SSL.

SSH is popular because its administrative overhead is relatively
low, compared to the other secure-connection schemes, however,
this plus can quickly become a minus--there may be no quick way to
revoke a user's access if the access keys become compromised.
(Suppose the president of a business connects to all his accounts
by SSH from his laptop computer, and then the laptop gets stolen
at the airport?)

(Just to complete the picture, security can be provided at a lower
level of the networking stack using IPsec.  With IPsec ESP beneath
it, even ordinary Telnet-over-TCP becomes secure.)

Anyway, for your investigation, you should check the following web
page, where I maintain links to nearly all terminal-emulation,
Telnet, and/or SSH client programs.

Most EULA's on commercial software say essentially the same thing --
disclaiming all warranties except replacing defective media.  Support is
certainly a valuable service, but let's not pretend that commercial
software vendors provide warranties as to the correct functioning of their
software.  Overwhelmingly, they do not.

It is not accurate to ascribe this behavior to "SSH," as if it were a
limitation of the protocol.  Rather, it is true if you use the default,
simplistic key-management/authorization mechanisms (known_hosts,
authorized_keys, etc.).  The main SSH implementations, both free and
commercial, now support Kerberos and PKI (and they interoperate to boot).

Perhaps I let poetic metaphor obscure the point.  With a commercial
product, when something goes wrong, you can generally get somebody
on the telephone to help you.  The "something" need not be a defect
in the program: there are many possible modes of failure.  Figuring
out the source of a problem often requires technically informed
diagnostic troubleshooting, and it is unwise to expect that a naive
user can perform such troubleshooting unassisted.

Support for free software is typically obtained from volunteers, who
frequent Usenet and certain web sites in their spare time and answer
questions out of a spirit of helpfulness.  But it is very difficult
for such a volunteer to direct a troubleshooting procedure while
communicating through casual Internet means.  For some problems,
you've got to talk interactively to solve them.

(It is possible that some third-party person or company will sell
the service of providing telephone support for a free software
product, but such support is not always available.)

If an organization's users are able to get by with volunteer support,
or if the organization contains experts who can help out when one
session's output mysteriously freezes (when somebody typed Control-S
by accident!), then there is more leeway to adopt free software.

OpenSSH and VShell/SecureCRT (VanDyke) support Kerberos via GSSAPI;
Tectia (ssh.com) supports both Kerberos and X.509 certificates.

Kermit 95 supports SRP, GSS-Kerberos 5, in addition to the traditional
shared keys and password based authentication methods.

PuTTY does _not_ support X.509 authentication with SSH.

(There may be some third-party fork/patch which does so,
but I'm not aware of one.)

Thanks for the reply - and thanks for the dialog package: we use it

unicode characters in filenames, too.

I have found part of the problem: with TERM=xterm or TERM=putty, dialog
outputs the old-fashioned <ESC>)0^Nlqqqqqqk^O style of line drawing -
which does not work in UTF-8 mode.  Is that a limitation of those
terminals themselves, or of the terminfo files?

With TERM=linux, dialog does output the correct line drawing characters
for PuTTY's UTF-8 mode, although the colouring of the background is not
completely filled in as it is on the console.

Does anyone know a Linux TERM setting that supports Unicode and gives
good results in PuTTY?

Actually that's a limitation of PuTTY (which is reflected in an accurate
terminfo file for it).  I'm told that in UTF-8 mode, PuTTY does not implement
the VT100-style shift-in and shift-out controls (the ^N and ^O characters),
but does recognize the analogous \E(B and \E(0 sequences.

For some reason, PuTTY's developers choose to not document the program(*),
e.g., by constructing appropriate terminfo/termcap entries.  I did get
some information from one of the former developers, but looking now, I
see that detail was overlooked (making a note to update & test...).

perhaps (untested)

        infocmp putty >foo

        edit foo, add/replace the strings for rmacs and smacs to read
        (keep the leading tabs on the lines)

                rmacs=\E(B, smacs=\E(0,

        tic foo

(*) this is not unusual, unfortunately (but what good is a terminal emulator

Hmm--what I was told was incorrect.  Reading the 5.6 source code, I see that
PuTTY completely ignores the \E(B, etc., in UTF-8 mode.  Using dialog built
with ncursesw, of course, that's not a problem.  (There's no need for me
to modify the "putty" terminfo description).

Reading down through the code, I also see a number of comments relating to
xterm--several are inaccurate, since the comments relate to features of
different versions of xterm (something like confusing xvt and Eterm).

I agree that the comments in terminal.c are dire in places.  If you could
tell us which ones you think are inaccurate and why, that would make
correcting them a lot easier.

offhand -
	The comment about ENQ has been obsolete for several years:

		http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html#xterm_90

	The documentation refers to titlebar sequences being supported
	by DECterm, but not xterm (xterm recognizes ST as well as BEL).

	The comment for CBT is misleading - a cursor control sequence which
	is standard, versus a reference to the kcbt string emitted by xterm.

	swap_screen - not exactly.  Blame the existing usage that doesn't
	allow for a stack in things like save-cursor, alternate-screen, etc.
	The comment would read better anyway by stating what the function
	does.

	xterm-style bright foreground/background (see ctlseqs.ms - that's
	borrowed from aixterm, and is not actually "bright" colors).

Also, I agree that it would be nice to know which manual is correct regarding
the introduction of ICH and ECH.  But the VT102 manual doesn't mention either.

Removed.  We blame [B] (source of much useful but horrid code,
and very few accurate comments).

Where?  The only mention of DECterm in doc/*.but is in the FAQ, which merely
states that DECterm's title-changing sequences are different from xterm's
(which is true; e.g. xterm uses OSC 1 ; Ps ST where DECterm uses
OSC 21 ; Ps ST).

Fixed.  Blame [B] again.

PuTTY got private modes 1047 and 1049 from xterm, so we blame their oddities
on xterm.  Xterm is free to pass the buck if it wants.


>	xterm-style bright foreground/background (see ctlseqs.ms - that's

Fixed.  If they're not actually bright colours, what are they?  The aixterm
documentation I've been able to find is singularly unhelpful in this area.

1047/1048 are identical to the 47 (except that they can be disabled easily).
1049's simply a nicer packaging of the two.

Either way, they're still used in the same context as 47, and subject to
the same limitations vis subprocesses reinitializing the screen.

16 distinct colors (the values of which are of course set by resources).

PuTTY (0.57) appears to be sending the appropriate window-size message
for the protocol regardless of how the window is resized.

There's a common problem where the SSH server (or whatever) only sends a
window size change notification (SIGWINCH) to the foreground process, so
if you resize while another process is running, and then exit that
process, the shell doesn't notice that the window size has changed.

Running "kill -WINCH $$" will then cause the bash shell to notice what
has happened.

I can reproduce this on Debian woody with bash as my shell and lynx in
the foreground, whether I resize by maximising or by changing the window
size, over SSH and Telnet protocols.

But lynx doesn't resize dynamically, so (unless you're pressing ^R to update
the display), you won't be able to test that.  That's done to limit network
activity, etc.

Most text editors will resize dynamically - that's a better test.

Since I'm demonstrating a problem with the shell, what the foreground
process does should be immaterial.

But, just for you, I reproduced it with vim too.

OK, I disabled alternate screen and now I got scrollback history.
When I'm attacched on screen and I exit from vi I see text inside on the
screen, I like alternate screen but I think this is a good solution,
but.. when I'm not attacched to screen I have screen *cleared* when exit
from vi (or less).. I do not like this behaviour so much..

Thanks, Pierluigi.

That could still be related to the alternate screen.  For example,
infocmp's output (looking at xterm-r6),

        rmcup=\E[2J\E[?47l\E8,
        smcup=\E7\E[?47h,

For this example, smcup saves the cursor position (assumed to be in the
normal screen) and switches to the alternate screen.

The rmcup string is emitted by vi on exit.  It clears the screen, switches
back from the alternate screen and restores the cursor position.

Simply disabling the \E[?47l and \E[?47h (switch between normal/alternate)
won't affect the clearing with \E[2J.  Modern xterm implements escape
sequences which combine all of those pieces into a single escape sequence
which can be suppressed.

Running in "screen", there are two $TERM values to take into account: the
one for screen (which as noted, does use the modern \E[?1049l), and the
external one (which could be rxvt, for instance--uses strings like xterm-r6).
rxvt doesn't implement that, BTW, though some other emulators have done so.

Thank's a lot Thomas Dickey,

I'm sorry, but I do not understand so much.. is this a solution or an
explanation of the problem? Perhaps my english is not so good :(

My question now is:
Can I use alternate screen (I found it very usefull) and say, in some
way, to PuTTY to disable it only when it's called by screen? (so I don't
lose scrollback history)

Someone has had this problem before?

Regards, Pierluigi.

Mostly an explanation.  Before running screen, what is $TERM set to?
And what does infocmp show at that point?  My guess is that it shows
strings something like I indicated.  (The "putty" terminfo entry which
I have in ncurses does this, but I thought it unlikely that you are
using that, since PuTTY defaults to setting TERM to "xterm").

If my guess is correct, you can fix that problem by changing the
terminfo entry which is set (either by modifying the terminfo entry--
a reasonably good idea if it is "putty"), or choosing one which is
closer (that's a little harder to advise).

I don't think so.  When screen first starts up, it uses the original $TERM's
value to initialize the display.  So it's no different from other applications
in that aspect.

ah OK, yes you were right, before running screen $TERM is set to "xterm",

rmcup=\E[2J\E[?47l\E8 and smcup=\E7\E[?47h.

Attached to screen $TERM is set to screen, rmcup=\E[?1049l and
smcup=\E[?1049h

mmm.. can you explain me better this last thing please? I have no idea

Yes.  Checking the history for ncurses' terminfo.src, I see that screen
3.9.13 added the 1049 code (and I added the corresponding change to ncurses
in late 2002).  xterm's terminfo generally has been the same as xterm-r6,
since that's been the default install for ncurses.  Most of the Linux
distributors modify that (no two alike, I think ;-).

They're mentioned in the (long) terminfo manpage, and are abbreviations,
e.g., reset-mode-cursor-positioning and set-mode-cursor-positioning.

Few terminals actually require those particular strings, but by convention,
xterm's alternate-screen strings are there (because they're sent at the
right time to be useful).

The corresponding termcap names are ti and te (terminal initialize, terminal
end).  xterm has a resource "titeInhibit" which deals with this.

Anyway--you're using putty which does support the 1049 code.  I'd set putty
to make $TERM set to "putty", and then modify the putty terminfo entry to
use the 1049 codes: use infocmp to get a text of the terminfo entry, replace
the two chunks of text for rmcup=XXX and smcup=XXX to match, and then run
tic to update it.

"tic" and "infocmp" operate on those files.  Use infocmp to get the contents.
If I were modifing the putty (binary) file, I'd do something like

        infocmp putty > foo
        vi foo
        tic foo

For example, on this host I have terminfo entries in my user directory
(since radixnet is _not_ my home machine):

Subject: PuTTY DECSED (Selective Erase) (Esc [ ? x J)


I've been using PuTTY for a while in various applications.  I really
like it, so I reached for it again for this latest application.
Unfortunately, this app requires being able to selectively erase text
on the screen ("Clear Foreground" text).  The VTxxx referes to this
capability as DECSED ("Esc [ ? x J", where x specifies the area of
erasure desired (I'm looking for x=2, the whole screen).  (There's
another similar facility called DECSEL).

I did discover that this facility is implemented in xterm, but I can't
use xterm here (sorry, it's on Windows -- not my choice).

I have a few alternatives:

1) Change the application to not use this facility.  I'd rather not,
   there's a lot of code in this app [that I "inherited"].

2) Use a different terminal emulator.  I suppose I could, but I'd
   rather do something else.  If someone has a suggestion for one,
   please let me know.  No, I don't want to pay an arm and a log for a
   commercial emulator that's otherwise not as good as PuTTY.

3) Modify PuTTY to do what I want.  This is my preferred course of
   action.  Not only will I benefit, but others will, too.  I can
   change it myself or I can ask someone else to do it.  I would
   change it myself, but I've not been in the PuTTY code and would
   take me an unknown amount of time to spin up.  If someone has a
   few pointers as to how this capability could be added -- where
   in the code to start looking -- I'd appreciate it.

Another option would be to ask someone else to do it.  Yes, I could
pay something, but not likely what the labor would be worth.

If anyone has any ideas on this, please let me know!

HELP!

Thanks!

This demonstrates the feature

Some people use Cygwin, which runs on windows.  (There are pros/cons to
using that, but it's certainly simpler to install it and compile a current
xterm, than to make PuTTY into a VT220-compatible terminal emulator.)

xterm supports ANSI color, VT220 emulation and UTF-8


There's an FAQ at

Subject: Colours in PuTTY vs Mac OS X command-line ssh client

I have a remote Ubuntu box, the default shell of which is bash. I have
tried connecting to it using PuTTY in Windows and using the command-
line ssh client of Mac OS X Leopard.

I notice that, when I connect using the command-line ssh client of
Leopard, the "username@hostname" string at the bash prompt is
automatically green, file names and directory names would also be
coloured when I issue the "ls" command. However, the same is not true
when I connect using PuTTY. How do I make PuTTY display colours the
way the Leopard command-line ssh client would?

Most likely, the remote system is choosing whether or not to display
colours based on the environment variable TERM.

So, step 1: run "echo $TERM" in both environments, and see whether
the results are different.

If they are, step 2: configure PuTTY to send the same terminal type
as Leopard's client (Connection > Data > Terminal-type string) and
see if that gets you colour.

No--that would seem rather intrusive--but Shift+PgUp/PgDn will do
the trick, as for some other terminals.

    http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.57/htmldoc/Chapter3.html#S3.1.2

(Of course, there are people who'd like Shift+PgUp to go to the server.
We should probably make this configurable.)

Since there were no howls of protest, this is now implemented in
the [new] PuTTY snapshots.

See PuTTY's configuration (window/translations).  Your session is
probably assuming that input is UTF-8 rather than ISO-8859-1.

(this should be in PuTTY's faq).

Thank you,

It is not in the FAQ (or I didn't find it). So it is not in Putty?
It is a host configuration?

Shockingly, we reserve our FAQ for questions which really are

Change the translation to UTF-8 and then save the change to the
Default Settings pseudo-session.

There is a known issue that can cause PuTTY 0.58 on Windows to display
some characters in different scripts as blanks, described here:

    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/win-font-linking.html

It's a side effect of support that was added for bidirectional text and
Arabic shaping.  Help with fixing it welcome.

No, there's no major security bugfixes in 0.58 over 0.57. 0.57, however,
does contain security-related fixes over 0.56.

If you're using Telnet, this setting may be relevant:

PuTTY can support an escape sequence to do this. However, it's turned
off by default for security reasons.

Windows PuTTYgen has very little command-line functionality.

About the only thing you can do is specify a key filename on the command
line, for it to load in initially.  The reasons for this are outlined at

You can probaly get the behavior you want by modifying your sshd_config
to allow "permituserenvironment" (and forcing sshd to reread the file)
and creating an appropriate ~/.ssh/environment file.  It should probably
define "ENV" and "PATH".  Note that it is your shell that is responsible
for this behavior, not ssh itself.

The shell on the remote system is not a login shell, so it doesn't run 
the user's .profile, so no user-specific umask is set.  So the 
system-wide default will be used.

You should probably use the -p option, which causes scp to copy the 
permissions from the original file.

Last week, a fellow sysadmin was complaining that her SSH sessions kept

Later, when walking by the console, she saw the message which indicates

I prefer scp myself, but its fundamentally the same stuff going on
regardless.  That said, I have seen problems with socket close semantics
between Solaris and other operating systems, Solaris waiting for the
connection close after the other end is long gone.  I've not worked
through the rfc's but I get the impression Solaris is trying to do the
right thing and other ip stacks don't do it properly in some cases.
vxWorks being the most notable offender- no suprise there.


> Anyclue what could be missconfigured?

I've also run into the connection drop issue using Samba, and solved it
similarly- in this case a bash script that ran find on the top level
directories then slept for a minute or two w/ repeat.  Adding
SO_KEEPALIVE to the Samba connections also helped solve the same problem
in other circumstances.

In regard to the NAT case, it was due to IP masquerading records on a
Linux box that were expiring and causing the connection to drop.
ipfilter uses much longer default timeouts.

I'm sort of wondering if there is a router involved which isn't
forwarding entirely properly.

Could there be some packet loss going on during your traffic spikes
thats causing the TCP connections trouble?

Subject: ssh-throttle

I got tired of all the script-kiddies with their hundreds of ssh
accesses, filling the log file when trying out invalid logins
and guessing the root password. I can't restrict ssh access
to a list of known hosts, as my users login from various systems
at home, on conferences etc.

So I came up with a simple way to lock out hosts after a certain
number of ssh accesses in a given time (3 in one minute works for me).

You'll need an ssh daemon that's linked against tcp-wrappers (default
with Sun's SSH, optional with OpenSSH). In /etc/hosts.deny you need:

 # ssh-throttle  sshd: ALL: spawn (/usr/sbin/ssh-throttle %a): ALLOW

Like this, on any ssh connection the script ssh-throttle will be called,
supplied with the IP address of the source host, and the connectionwill be allowed. ssh-throttle keeps track of the connections, and
adds a DENY rule right after "# ssh-throttle" to /etc/hosts.deny.

You can add default ALLOW rules for friendly hosts or networks above
the "# ssh-throttle", so those connections will never be throttled.

Here's the ssh-throttle script:

  #!/bin/sh

  clog="/var/run/ssh-throttle"
  clogt="/tmp/ssh-throttle.$$"  deny="/etc/hosts.deny"
  tdeny="/tmp/hosts.deny.$$"
  limit=3

  hh=`/usr/bin/date +%H`
  mm=`/usr/bin/date +%M`
  ip=$1

  # Log connection
  echo "$hh $mm $ip" >> $clog

  # See if there were more than $limit connections from $ip in one minute
  count=`grep "$hh $mm $ip" $clog | wc -l`
  if test $count -gt $limit  then
    # Check if the IP address is already listed in hosts.deny
    #
    exist=`grep "$ip" $deny`    if test "$exist" = ""
    then
      # Log a warning, and add an entry to hosts.deny
      #
      logger -p auth.warn -t ssh-throttle "Denying $ip ($hh:$mm)"
      cat $deny | sed "/# ssh-throttle/a\\
sshd: $ip: DENY
" > $tdeny
      mv $tdeny $deny
    fi
  fi

  # Only keep current entries in the connection log
  grep "$hh $mm " $clog > $clogt
  mv $clogt $clog

Maybe it's of use for someone else, too. The basic concept isn't
restricted to ssh, it could easily be extended to protect other
services, too.

Answer:

Basically, SST puts in place its own /etc/hosts.allow and
/etc/hosts.deny . In /etc/hosts.allow I modified the sshd entry from
sshd:           LOCAL
to
sshd:           ALL
and it all worked as expected.

OK--an update including a circumvention which may even be the right fix.
Thanks to my colleagues locally for assistance, especially Steve Ison.

It seems that the problem arises if you started from a sufficiently
ancient Solaris 9 MU, and have been maintaining via patches since
then. The fix is to modify /etc/krb5/krb5.conf as follows:

  1. comment out ___slave_kcds___ in the [realms] section
  2. comment out ___domain_mapping___ in the [domain_realm] section
  3. add "___domainname___ = ___default_realm___" in the latter
     (actually, this third seems not to be neccesary)

Similar problems have arisen before in a different context, see:

    http://unix.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.unix.solaris/2004-06/0632.html

The patches ought to fix /etc/krb5/krb5.conf themselves (or have
a prereq patch that does) of course.

Or add the shared name to each key explicitly.  Then you can use either
the shared or private name, and each host can have separate keys.

I've got it working, with quite a bit of help from some folks here.
Google this group for "pam query ldap" - there's some links to
recommended pam.conf files which should help.

I'd recommend setting up a zone so you can play around^W^Wtest this
stuff properly. It'll save a few blushes and reboots ;-)

I assume you're using PAM?  The usual reason for this is that you're
using keyboard-interactive authentication for PAM and the "Password: "
prompt is directly from PAM.  If so, there are two possible options:

a) Configure PAM to provide the host's name in its password prompt
somehow.

b) Use password authentication instead of keyboard-interactive either
by removing keyboard-interactive from PreferredAuthentications on the
client or by disabling ChallengeResponseAuthentication on the server.

(on OpenSSH 3.7x and 3.8x this would have authenticated without using PAM,
however on 3.9 and up, and 3.6x and below it will use PAM).

None of the above.

SSH encrypts every time--whether -L or -R or neither are used.

The "-L" is not mnemonic for "normal" but for "local".


If I log in to CLIENT host and then run ...

        ssh -L 7777:localhost:110 SERVER

Then SSH creates a new port nunber 7777 on the CLIENT.

If I connect to localhost:7777 from the client, then I
am actually talking to SERVER:110.

But if I had run

        ssh -R 7777:localhost:110 SERVER

Then SSH creates the new port number 7777 on the SERVER
(not the client). Now if I log into the SERVER and connect
to its port 7777, I wind up talking to port 110 on the CLIENT.

So.. -L creates a local port that allows me to access a remote
        service.

     -R makes a local service available to the remote machine
        on a port that "looks" local to the remote system.

Confusing, I know--but I hope that helps to clarify things.

The "passwd" program is trying to read its input from its controlling
terminal, and when you run it that way there's no controlling terminal,
only stdin/stdout/stderr.

If you're using OpenSSH, try adding a "-t" to request a pty (two -t's to
force it), ie:
ssh -t SERVERB "passwd USER1"

If you're using some other software then check for an equivalent option.

This behaviour means that the server has not assigned a terminal device
for your session. This could be for one of several reasons:

 * (Unlikely) You're using SSH, and you've configured PuTTY not to ask
   for a terminal device (SSH panel > "Don't allocate a pseudo-terminal",
   or "-T" option).

 * PuTTY did ask for a terminal device (this is implicit with
   Telnet/Rlogin, and the default behaviour with SSH), but the server
   refused to allocate one. (You can see if this has happened in PuTTY's
   Event Log -- there will be a message "Server refused to allocate
   pty".)

   This could be because the server has run out of pseudo-terminals, or
   is misconfigured in some way. (It's not uncommon for servers to have
   too few pseudo-terminals configured; the limit can usually be
   increased.)

It is best if you can persuade the server to allocate you a
pseudo-terminal, but if you can't, there are some settings in PuTTY that
you can set to achieve some semblance of a normal interactive session.

For instance, to deal with the "stair-stepping" you see, you can set the
option `Implicit CR in every LF'.

http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-crlf

IIRC, you may also need to enable local echo.

Subject: PuTTY - patch to allow tiling on windows

I have been using PuTTY (on windows) for a half year now, and first let
me say how nice these tools are, and how nice it is to have the source.

The one problem I have had is that windows tiling (via ctrl-right-click
on windows taskbar icons, then Tile Horizontally or Tile Vertically)
doesn't work with PuTTY.  Neither do the sizing features of utilities
such as http://www.thewonderfulicon.com/
This capability is essential for me, and would have been a deal-breaker.

I believe this is the same problem reported here:
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/win-tile.html

This capability is essential for me, and would have been a deal-breaker.
But I was able to patch PuTTY to fix this problem.  Essentially, I just
turned off some code intended to prevent "unexpected" resizes, and turned
off code that prevented resizes when is_alt_pressed() is true.

Warning!  This patch breaks full-screen (alt-enter) mode.  And I
wouldn't be surprised if it breaks other features too.  But I've been
using my patch since last June and it hasn't broken anything else that
I notice.  I would like to find time to learn enough about PuTTY's code
to do a better, cleaner patch, but I don't know when that would be.

I'm attaching my patch in case it might be useful to other users.
It is a -u format patch to the 0.58 version of the WINDOW.C file
(the release source code, not the latest development snapshot).
It can be applied like this:  patch -u window.c tilepatch

Or, since it is so short, I am also listing it here;
one could simply make the indicated changes manually:

I think this is because the DOS window (by which you presumably mean
cmd.exe?) does something odd.

I usually get round this by using Windows's magic "start" command:
try running

  start putty system -l user -pw password

(ObSecurity: you might consider using public keys as an alternative

sure, putty has command line options that let you do things like this.
For example, something this would work in a batch file:

    putty -ssh -l myid -pw mypassword whatever.whereever.com

You will *probably* need some type of support in your terminal program
for scripting/macros.  I am guessing your process needs to go something
like this:

1.  PC goes down for whatever reason.

2.  PC comes back up.

3.  Several instances of your terminal program start up, because you put
    shortcuts to them in Windows' Startup folder, or equivalent technique
    in your OS.  Each instance "knows" (via command-line switches or a
    config file) what the port settings are, the name of the log file to
    open, etc.

4.  Some macro facility in your terminal program simulates you typing on
    the PC keyboard to send the characters that will cause the remote
    systems to start emitting the data of interest.

It sounds like you're stuck on #4.  I've used Tera Term before as a good
"simple" terminal emulator; I seem to recall that recent versions of Tera
Term do include a simple scripting language, but I've never tried it.

On Windows, once I get beyond what Tera Term does well, I tend to use IVT
http://home.wxs.nl/~ruurdb/IVT.HTM .  It has lots of options, so it may
take you a while to navigate them all, but you should be able to make it
do about anything you want.

As far as what keystrokes are needed to make your remote systems start
outputting the data you want to capture, that will depend on each remote
system.  IVT has a "recorder" mode - switch it on and manually type the
keystrokes to start the remote application, switch it off again, and save
the keystrokes in a script file.  Don't forget to add some error-checking
to handle the cases where the remote system won't come up.

Like Matt, I am vaguely aware that Tera Term Pro has a scripting 
language, but don't know anything about it.

Kermit http://www.columbia.edu/kermit has a very capable scripting 
language.

The KEA series of terminal emulators from Attachmate also have a good 
scripting language.

Subject: Some terminal enhancements into PuTTY

Hi all,

I was a bit sad that PuTTY filters some key combinations, so I played
around with the code this morning to get some shortcuts working in
ViM ;-)

    http://spunt.kebule.cz/home/putty-xterm-hacks.patch

1) Apps key (the one to the left from right control) is no longer
   taken as a compose key but sent as an escape sequence like in xterm.
2) Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown are no longer used for vertical
   scrolling.
3) Ctrl-Backspace acts like Shift-Backspace (^H <--> Ctrl-?)
4) Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp and PageDown are no longer
   filtered when shift/control pressed and sent with additional ";5",
   etc. modifiers.
5) Shift-arrows are no longer filtered and sent as escape sequences
   like in xterm.

Positive feedback welcome ;-)

Vladimir.

For administrative access to NetApp (Network Appliance) storage appliances
running Data ONTAP:

Because of the usual security concerns in administering storage filers and
cache appliances via the "telnet" and "rsh" protocols, NetApp provides an
SSH access method.

To initially set up a storage appliance for SSH connections, find out if
special any special key-length constraints are required on your network,
then run the short interactive dialogue by invoking:

    toaster*> secureadmin setup ssh

The keys generated will be:

    /etc/sshd/ssh_host_key
    /etc/sshd/ssh_host_rsa_k
    /etc/sshd/ssh_host_dsa_key.

There is a minor bug (187989) in some versions of the Data ONTAP (7G/Classic)
kernel in which a command prompt fails to appear upon establishment of an SSH
session.  There is an easy workaround: before trying the SSH session, use the
serial console to create an /etc/motd file (on the appliance) which ends with
a bona fide Return character.  For example:

    wrfile /etc/motd
    <return>
    <control-C>

In releases of Data ONTAP since 7.0.1, there are some options for tweaking
the interaction between serial-console and SSH sessions; contact NetApp
Global Support for information on how to set these.

If you are using PuTTY as the client software with protocol version SSH2,
and then you find that the line-editing functions do not work, then change
the following PuTTY settings: 

On the Terminal tab

 * set Local Echo to "Force off"
 * set Local Line Editing to "Force Off"

On the SSH tab

 * check "Don't Allocate a Pseudo-terminal"

(You can save this configuration for future use in the Session tab.)

For filer settings of the SSH2 protocol, consult the "secureadmin_inbound"
configuration in "/etc/local.cfg".

You should also set PuTTY *not* to repeat the key exchange every hour.
(This same restriction applies to several SSH servers derived from open source.)

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

211360 / SSH responds with message "unsupported channel request for env"

When an SSH client connects to Data ONTAP, in addition to opening a
channel for the main session, the SSH client may attempt to open an
auxiliary channel.  Such channels are typically used to forward
display-output data from X-Windows applications (using X11 Forwarding)
or to transmit shell-environment parameters for the user session.
Since Data ONTAP does not support X11 Forwarding or other uses of such
additional SSH channels, the storage controller will log a warning
message of this form:

  [toaster: openssh.invalid.channel.req:warning]:
  SSH client (SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.9) from 192.168.12.34
  sent unsupported channel request (10, env).

If the SSH session is otherwise authorized, the warning may be ignored.


To workaround the problem:

On the SSH client, disable features which may request to open auxiliary 
channels.  Such features include SendEnv and X11 Forwarding.  The exact 
means of disabling the features depends on the client program.

Notes:

For the OpenSSH client invoked from a Linux or Unix host, adding the
"-x" option on the command line should disable the X11 Forwarding feature.
If no users on that Linux or Unix host will ever use X11 Forwarding,
the feature can be turned off in the host-wide configuration in the file
/etc/ssh_config (or /etc/ssh/ssh_config): uncomment or otherwise insert
a line in that file which says:

    ForwardX11 no

Also, comment out or remove any "SendEnv" lines in that file.
(These features may also be controlled in per-user configuration files
or by command-line options.)

Text is automatically copied to the clipboard when you select it; it is
the clipboard contents that are pasted into the PuTTY window when you
right-click, and should be pasted into any other application when you
invoke the "paste" action in the usual way.

This won't copy text in PuTTY -- the Ctrl+C will be sent to the server
(where it will probably interrupt a process, or something similar).

This, however, does work to paste text _into_ PuTTY.

This is user-configurable in many emulators. CTRL+ "chords" can either
be processed locally, or be forwarded to the host.

Subject: Bringing ssh connections back to life after hibernation

In my setup I sometimes have to put my computer to hibernate when I
have one or more ssh (OpenSSH, in fact) connections to remote hosts.
My hibernate setup is such that when I bring my computer back to life
the network is up and running immediately. However, my ssh connections
to remote hosts take some 10-15 minutes to revive.

Anybody know why that should be the case? Anybody know if there is some
OpenSSH configuration parameter that would get the ssh connections back
to life quickly?

For what it's worth, I think I have found a solution to my problem.
(Not for the first time immediately after asking for a answer to some
question in the net, either.) If in my /etc/ssh/ssh_config I enter the
lines

        ServerAliveCountMax 1
        ServerAliveInterval 10

then my connections seem to come back quickly enough after reviving my
computer.

While the latter looks useful, the former seems counterproductive,
at least in my situations. I.e., it says that, if once the server does
not respond to the ServerAlive message, you are disconnected. That
seems pretty harsh.

Mostly a ssh connection can survive such thing easily with static
IP, if you just keep the xterm with the login open. YMMV

The above would disconnect the unresponsive session 10 seconds
after the first packet got no answer as per client-side configuration.

Indeed this is more useful on the sshd side to stop firewalls from
automatic disconnecting idle sessions there are far better ways to do
this than a firewall could. but although to let sshd disconnect broken
sessions cleanly, without "filling" up utmp and associated tools with
ghost logins.

  ClientAliveCountMax
  ClientAliveInterval

Default of the later is zero, disabling sending messages to the
client at all.

Generate a passphrase less key-par for UserA@systemA and update

    $HOME(UserB@SystemB)/.ssh/authorized_keys

with the new pub  key .

and then ssh into the system using the privkey with -i flag

Subject: PuTTY DECSED (Selective Erase) (Esc [ ? x J)

I've been using PuTTY for a while in various applications.  I really
like it, so I reached for it again for this latest application.
Unfortunately, this app requires being able to selectively erase text
on the screen ("Clear Foreground" text).  The VTxxx referes to this
capability as DECSED ("Esc [ ? x J", where x specifies the area of
erasure desired (I'm looking for x=2, the whole screen).  (There's
another similar facility called DECSEL).

I did discover that this facility is implemented in xterm, but I can't
use xterm here (sorry, it's on Windows -- not my choice).

I have a few alternatives:

1) Change the application to not use this facility.  I'd rather not,
there's a lot of code in this app [that I "inherited"].

2)  Use a different terminal emulator.  I suppose I could, but I'd
rather do something else.  If someone has a suggestion for one, please
let me know.  No, I don't want to pay an arm and a log for a
commercial emulator that's otherwise not as good as PuTTY.

3)  Modify PuTTY to do what I want.  This is my preferred course of
action.  Not only will I benefit, but others will, too.  I can change
it myself or I can ask someone else to do it.  I would change it
myself, but I've not been in the PuTTY code and would take me an
unknown amount of time to spin up.  If someone has a few pointers as
to how this capability could be added -- where in the code to start
looking -- I'd appreciate it.

Another option would be to ask someone else to do it.  Yes, I could
pay something, but not likely what the labor would be worth.

If anyone has any ideas on this, please let me know!

HELP!

Thanks!

When I SSH into most of my newer linux machines from my windows

The character sequences look like an 'a' with a hat over it and a
cursive upper case 'E'.

It's very annoying particularly with gcc output as these characters
end up around every identifier that appears in a gcc warning.

I've tried numerous different terminal emulation settings in my ssh
program, to no avail.  [surprise, surprise]

I'm sure I used to know how to turn this off (it seems like there was
an environment variable to set), but I forgot...  Can anyone remind me?

Thanks,
Scott

You need to set the TERM environment variable in your login shell.  If
you use putty, setting TERM to either "linux", "ansi" or "xterm" should
work fine in your case.

No luck there, it doesn't seem to make any difference. The default is
vt100, which is what my ssh client is set to.   I tried changing it
(both the term variable and the ssh client) to linux, ansi, and xterm
to no avail.


I did manage to find the previous "fix" for this issue, which was to put:

    export LANG="POSIX"

in my .bashrc file.

Strangely enough, this works for RHEL4, but on RHEL5, it changes the
funny characters to a string <E2><80><99>, which I'm assuming is the
hex values of the funny characters it was printing.

The $TERM variable is unrelated.  It's the locale settings (man locale).

This is a consequence of a mismatched locale setting. The newer box is
(probably) configured to use UTF8 but for some reason your pager doesn't
know it.

For other people reading this post, you can probably reproduce it like
this (replacing en_GB.UTF8 with an appropriate locale):

    LANG=en_GB.UTF8 man ls | LANG= less

To avoid it, you need to ensure that everything runs in the same locale.
So either remove LANG entirely, or ensure that it's set consistently
everywhere:

        unset LANG              # Maybe in your .profile / .bash_profile
        man ls                  # Etc...

If you're using xterm windows anywhere, start using uxterm (or better,
lxterm) instead.

Thanks for the info.

Now that I know what is causing it, I think I've fixed it by telling
my SSH client to use UTF-8 instead of 'default' which was what it was
configured to use.

When you run "ssh-keygen", it creates both a public and private key.
You have to use the private key that was made at the same time as
the public key, because key generation incorporates random data.

Every time you run "ssh-keygen" you'll get different keys, even if
you enter the same passphrase, and you can't mix and match them.

What version of ssh are you using - the one supplied with Solaris? If
so, the server is at /usr/lib/ssh/sshd and the client at /usr/bin/ssh.

I've server up password-less ssh on numerous machines and it works every
time as I said. It *might* be possible to disable it in the server
config file, but by default it should work.

bash-3.00$ ssh -V
Sun_SSH_1.1, SSH protocols 1.5/2.0, OpenSSL 0x0090704f

If you see something mixing an ssh server from ssh.com, and a client
from OpenSSL, it might be the cause, as I don't think the keys are
compatible, although I believe you can convert from one key to the
other. I've long since stopped using the tools from ssh.com.

Looking at your outputs in more detail, you don't provide sufficient
information for me to be 100% sure what you are doing.

This is my client where I log in from.

There should be only one key in $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub, which is created with

$ ssh-keygen -t dsa

This is the server which I log into. In this case, there are two keys,
as I log into it from two different machines.

I think the username@server is ignored - it is only there to help you
remember what key is what.

To get it to work both ways, from machine A to B and from B to A, you
need to:

1) Append $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub of A to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys of B.
This allows you to connect from A to B.

1) Append $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub of B to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys of A.
This allows you to connect from B to A.

I'm not sure if blank lines are allowed in $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

Blank lines are probably ignored, but server could just stop reading at
that point. I note you have a blank line.

Good call, Dave.  The instructions that didds' support service pointed
him to mentions that ssh is provided starting with Solaris 9 and that it
uses "authorized_keys" instead of "authorized_keys2".  But that's not
mentioned until paragraph #14 or so.

Yes, *at the target box*, only operator matters.  So you'd put the
public keys of all the authorized users into ~operator/.ssh/authorized_keys.

That gives all the authorized users access to the operator account.

Bad, bad idea.  This has all kinds of security implications, none of them
good; the worst part is you've just made it impossible to distinguish
between operator and the other users for *any* attempts to gain ssh access
via private key, anywhere.

Subject: Kudos to Putty developers, answer not necessary

Summary: A big thank you to the Putty team - and all who developped
ssh to the point where Putty could get started - for a *reliable*
piece of software. I have clearly spent too many years in the
Microsoft world as I had all but forgotten how it feels to leave a
program running overnight or longer and come back and find it still up
and running, without hogging virtual memory and generally just
behaving well without any extra fuss. Thanks!

Details:

I woke up to continue on some work that was left half-way yesterday
and noticed that the Putty terminals to both *nix servers that I had
left open on my laptop were alive and well. And suddenly I was washed
over with such relief and gratitude - there still is software around
that is stable and reliable, that won't crash on you the minute you
turn your back (or earlier), that won't start gobbling up virtual
memory after running more than one hour and that won't *require* an
update every one or two weeks just to stay tolerably functional.

Mostly out of professional necessity (all of my customers use Windows
and MS Office) I have used mainly Windows for the last five years or
so. Before that I used mostly Unix or Linux (my first Unix-like
experience was on a Zilog System 8000 in 1987-88, and it was love at
first sight). This experience with Putty is just one more lately that
makes me more convinced that my next laptop will be Linux-based, and
as much as possible of the software on it will be open-source. Then at
least if something does not work, I have the consolation that a) I did
not pay a cent for it anyway and b) if that particular functionality
really is important for me I can help fix it.

Thanks for making my Sunday morning & happy hacking!

The native format for keypairs is different, but PuTTYgen can freely
interconvert between OpenSSH's and its own formats.

See the PuTTYgen documentation for more information:

    http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.60/htmldoc/Chapter8.html#pubkey-puttygen

> What are the default file extensions of public and private key files?

PuTTYgen's default extension for keypair files (which contain private
key material) is .PPK. The PuTTY suite doesn't have a "native" format
for public key files.

OpenSSH, deriving as it does from a Unix background, doesn't really use
Windows-style file extensions. Key files are traditionally called
id_rsa.pub (for the public key) and id_rsa (for the keypair), for the
example of an RSA keypair.

I don't know about other implementations.

Small note: I'd urge people to use DSA keys for the use of SSH 2 and
its features, over those of SSH 1. But tastes on this vary, for both
excellent technical reasons and simple widespread rumors.

But yes, Puttygen deals well with both.

I just find myself wishing that ssh-keygen and Puttygen, both, would
insist by default that a passphrase be provided and that a command-line
option or special secret option be used to prevent the generation of
passphrase keys, because I am amazingly tired of explaining to people
that keys without passwords are like putting your housekeys under the
doormat.

I remember reading something in a manual about this a long time ago. I think
it was so that final output is preserved on the screen. It did not concern me,
because I was only opening windows to access a remote, and it was easy enough
to close them.

From memory there was an option to prevent this. I did a quick Google to
jog my memory, and it tells me "close window on exit" from the session menu.
It didn't jog my memory any further though. I would just try that one and see.

Mark.

In the Session panel of the PuTTY Configuration, I see an option called
"Close window on exit with 3 options: Always, Never, Only on clean exit
See if playing with that helps...

This is an oldish thread but we got the same problem recently.

The problem was caused by script-kiddies running botnets, scanning the
SSH servers with a dictionary attack.

The SSH servers refuse connections after MaxStartups from the botnet
is reached.

From "man sshd_config"

 MaxStartups

         Specifies the maximum number of  concurrent  unauthenti-
         cated   connections   to  the  sshd  daemon.  Additional
         connections are dropped until authentication succeeds or
         the LoginGraceTime expires for a connection. The default
         is 10.

The solution was to increase the MaxStartups in /etc/sshd_config and
block the botnets with something like "DenyHosts"

    http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/

"less" has deliberately asked for it, by sending a terminal control
code which  changes the mode of the numeric keypad.

There's an option in PuTTY to disable that code: try

    Terminal > Features > Disable application keypad mode.

In 0.60, the following method is cumbersome, but works:

 - Press Alt+E to focus the saved-session box
 - Type the session name or a prefix
 - Press Alt+L to load the session
 - Press Alt+O to open the loaded session

(Clearly the experience of keyboard-only users could be improved.)
