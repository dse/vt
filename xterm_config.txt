!    Xterms can be designed from three different sets of resources:
! VT100, Tektronix (or TEK4104), and generic Xterm resources.  In
! Some instances, you cannot get the effects you want by simply
! using the generic Xterm resources.  The scrollbar, which is a VT100
! component, is one of them.  True, you could have used Xterm*scrollBar
! to activate the scrollbar, but you would run out of luck if you tried
! setting its color without using VT100.
!    The other resources in the example are typical settings.
! Resources may be specified in $HOME/.Xdefaults or other locations.
