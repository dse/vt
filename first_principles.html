First Thoughts about Terminal Emulation
</H3>

<B>Question from a website visitor:</B><BR>

<!--  (UL) (UL) -->
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     I was wondering if you could give me the differences
     between various terminal emulation such as VT52, VT100,
     VT220, etc.?  I just need basic and very brief info.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- (/UL)(/UL) -->

<B>Attempt at an Answer:</B><BR>

<P>
This question is rather general, so a full answer would be book-length.
Here are a few thoughts, and pointers for some things to look at.
</P>

<P>
An "emulation" of a terminal type is something that acts in the same
way a real physical terminal of that type acts.  So you need to know
about the real physical terminals that were known by those names.
</P>

<P>
A software implementation of terminal emulation is typically a program
that runs on a PC.  This program causes the PC to act like some particular
type of terminal.  When the PC communicates with another computer
(the remote <I>host</I> computer), the remote host thinks that it is
actually communicating with a terminal of that type.  
The terminal-emulation program must emulate such things as
understanding control-code sequences to position the cursor on the
screen and emitting control-code sequences that tell the remote host when
some function key has been pressed.
</P>

<P>
Historically, the yawning chasm between two major varieties of video-display
terminal was between terminals that communicate in the
<A HREF = "http://www.InstantWeb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=ASCII&action=Search"
>ASCII</A> code and terminals that communicate in the 
<A HREF = "http://www.InstantWeb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?EBCDIC"
>EBCDIC</A> code.  However, use of the EBCDIC code
has been in decline for quite some time, so almost all terminals you
are likely to see still around in <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 2004 use ASCII.
(The 
<A HREF = "http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/3270.html"
>IBM 3270 series terminals</A>
were the most common EBCDIC type.)
</P>

<!-- "ibm_ebcdic_terminals_news.txt" -->

<P>
There is another significant divide, among various kinds of video
terminals that speak ASCII, between the terminals that use one of many
varying proprietary control encodings and the terminals that use control
encodings that are subsets of the
<A HREF = "ansi_x3_64.txt"
>ANSI X3.64 standard</A> (or the related standards ISO DP6429 or
<A HREF="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-048.HTM"
>ECMA-48</A>.)
The latter are broadly referred to as "ANSI compatible" terminal types.
</P>

<P>
The
<A HREF = "http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/vt52.html"
>VT52</A> was an early-1970s product of
<A HREF="http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/links/dec_memorial_site.html"
>Digital Equipment Corporation</A>
(DEC) which employed one of those proprietary control codes.
(Other vendors, such as
<A HREF = "http://members.cox.net/oldcomp/lsi.htm"
>Lear-Siegler</A>,
<A HREF = "http://vt100.net/hazeltine/h1420-rm/"
>Hazeltine</A>, and 
<A HREF = "televideo.html"
>Televideo</A> made
proprietary-code ASCII terminals, but these were different and were
<I>not</I> generally compatible with the 
<A HREF = "http://vt100.net/docs/vt52-mm/"
>VT52</A>.)
</P>

<P>
The ANSI X3.64 standard was written by the
<A HREF = "http://www.x3.org/incits/tc_home/l2.htm"
>X3L2 Technical Committee on Codes and Character Sets</A>
and was finished in about 1979, and some people (at the time) thought
it was so complicated nobody would ever use it, but the Heath/Zenith
company made a product that used it and showed that implementing (at
least a subset of) X3.64 was possible.  (Some of the more complicated
parts of X3.64 have always been ignored, though.)
</P>

<P>
The
<A HREF = "http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/vt100.html"
>VT100</A> was the first product of DEC built to understand a set of control
codes compatible with ANSI X3.64.  The VT100 became a very popular
product, and many other companies essentially copied it, such that 
many terminal products on the market were not merely "ANSI compatible"
but were more specifically "VT100 compatible", copying the layout of the
<A HREF = "vt100_keyboard.gif"
>keyboard</A>, etc.  (Yet the VT100 had in it a feature to help people
who had started out with VT52s: the VT100 could be set to act as
though it were a VT52, in an emulation mode.)
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(One confusion that sometimes arises: some vendors (such as
<A HREF = "http://www.sco.com/" >SCO</A>)
defined other so-called "ANSI" terminal types for their operating-system
console drivers; these virtual devices are close to, but are not
completely compatible with, a VT100 type.  Other such types include
QANSI, AT386, ANSI-BBS, and ANSI.SYS.  Linux-console is another..
<A HREF = "http://www.microsoft.com/"
>Microsoft</A> confuses the issue by <I>seeming</I> to offer separate "VT100"
and "ANSI" emulations in its Windows Telnet program.  However, the two
settings behave identically, and both are closer to ANSI-BBS than to VT100.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
DEC kept coming up with better (or at least different) ideas on
how to make video terminals, so new DEC models were announced in
subsequent years...the VT220, VT240, 
<A HREF = "http://vt100.net/docs/vt320-uu/"
>VT320</A>,
VT340, VT420, 
<A HREF = "http://www.boundless.com/Text_Terminals/VT/VT_520/"
>VT520</A>, etc.  
But while each new model incorporated new features, it could do all
of the functions of the old VT100:  that is, each new model was said to be 
"<A HREF = "http://www.InstantWeb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?backward+compatible"
>backward compatible</A>" with previous models.  Corresponding terminal
emulations have been developed for most of the newer DEC models, but the
VT100 remained the lowest common denominator of compatibility.
</P>

<P>
A 
<A HREF = "dec_term_function_checklist.ps"
>PostScript file kept on my website</A>
contains a long list of precisely
which DEC terminal models contained which features.
(PostScript files can be read using 
<A HREF = "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html"
>GhostScript</A>, if you have no other
way.  But most high-end laser printers
can directly print PostScript.)
