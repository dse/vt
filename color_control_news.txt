News of Color Control Sequences for Character-Cell Terminals 

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The original ANSI X3.64-1979 standard did not define a method of
specifying color text attributes.

However, the two subsequent standards ISO 6429 and ECMA-48 did
define a method of setting colors using the SGR (set graphics
rendition) controls.  See:

    http://www.ecma.ch/stand/ECMA-048.HTM

These so-called "ISO color controls" have been widely adopted by
authors of terminal-emulation software, although few real video
terminals implement them.

(For instance, most products claiming to emulate a DEC VT320 do
include support for ISO color, although a real VT320 has only a 
monochrome screen, and its graphics counterpart, the VT340, did
NOT support ISO color, relying instead on ReGIS color controls.)

The arguments over ambiguities in the standard appear below!

A reasonable argument, but....

When I did mterm, I made SGR value 0 reset the colors, because it
actually has ten colors: the eight ISO 6429 values and the
startup-defined foreground and background values.  SGR value 0 returns
to writing foreground on background; without this, there is no way to
return to foreground-on-background once the color-setting sequences
have been used.

What do you feel would have been the right thing to do?  I'm not
especially happy with my solution, and if you have another one to
suggest I'd like to hear it.

I suppose I could have used 38 and 48 to specify the startup foreground
and background colors or something, but I like that less than what I
did....

Actually, this depends on how you define your color model.  If you
assume that the user has set up their desktop with colors that work for
them, then you should only be using the color enhancements for the
purpose of "enhancing" text.  If I find that terminal emulators with a
background of dim gray and a foreground of white work for me, why would
I want to find myself running an application with a background of
magenta and a foreground of cyan just because you find that attractive.
On the other hand, if you are using white text on a red background to
highlight a warning message, then it doesn't matter what color the rest
of the window is.

The only real reason to clear the window in the current background color
is if you can't switch back to the original (user specified) background
color.  In a dumb terminal world, it may be possible to assume that the
default background is black and the default foreground is white.
However, in an X windows world (with some sort of consistent desktop),
you can't make any assumptions on what the default colors are.  It is
best to assume that the background and foreground are set to what the
user want it to be and to treat the background and color enhancements
the same as any other enhancement.  You should no sooner be turning on a
blue background for the entire window than you should be turning on
bold, faint, blinking, or underlined text for the entire window.  If you
want a terminal emulator with a blue background, then just run one with
a blue background.

As I said above, my expectation is that reverse video has no effect on
erasing text.  It should only have an effect on text that is displayed.
In that case, the foreground and background colors should simply be
reversed.

As I indicated above, you shouldn't be using it this way.  Just clear
the screen and leave the users color choice alone.  The color
enhancements were not meant to be used as a color style manager for the
terminal window.

I would suggest that you rethink your use of color.  I don't think that
the ANSI or ISO committees will be rethinking their definition of color.
In addition, the terminal emulator for the CDE desktop will be
supporting this color model as well (along with a style manager that can
be used to select default background colors).

12 lines.  Suppose that JOE USER wants the readonly window to be displayed
as black/green and the non-readonly window as yellow/blue
(foreground/background colors). Unfortunately, with your color model this
will be difficult to support because the user cannot simultaneously have
both a green and a blue background and again the editor will be forced to
writing spaces in one of the windows.  If the ``wrong'' window is zoomed to
full screen, the situation will be even worse.  Of course a user of this
type of terminal will probably choose to set the colors to his terminals
default background.  However, a user with a terminal that supports my color
model (e.g., linux console) will not have to do this can have the windows in
different colors without wasting bandwidth writing spaces for the sole
purpose of setting the background color.  

I have thought quite a bit about my color model and I have practical
experience dealing with terminals of both color models.  Until you can
convince me otherwise, I will say that without any hesitation that the
``linux'' color is superior to the one that you are talking about.

I can see how in this type of an application, it would be useful to have
a terminal emulator that did clear text with the current background
color.  The ISO and ANSI spec say that the various erase escape
sequences put the character position into the erase state, and then say
that the representation of the erase state is implementation specific.
I guess that from that statement, you could say that the background
color is the current active background color.  The VT420 manual is very
specific and states that all visual character attributes are cleared.
Background color is a visual attribute.

It would be nice if there was a way to toggle between the two fill
modes.  Unfortunatly, there is not.  The industry trend seems to be to
implement the fill with default background color model.  Sorry...

Fortunately the writer of the Linux console did not follow the trend.  There
are so few applications that support colors and I doubt very much that many
will break if regions were erased with the current background color rather
than the default background color.  

Are there any programs for ANSI color terminals that fail to function
properly when used on the linux console?

From the KERMIT.UPD for version 3.14:

SET TERMINAL COLOR 20
  If Kermit receives a "reset visual attributes" escape sequence (CSI 0 m)
  from the host, this does not affect the screen coloration.  However, some
  applications expect it to restore the default fore- and background colors.
  SET TERMINAL COLOR 20 tells Kermit to do this.  v3.14.

By the way, if you have any official DEC documentation that says this should
be the default behavior, we'd like to see it.  Our DEC VT manuals list the
actions to be taken on CSI 0 m very explicitly, and none of them affect the
coloration.

-----------

	Let's separate these items.

	SET DISPLAY  or  SET TERM BYTESIZE 7 or 8

	Color has nothing to do with 7 or 8 bit comms channels. Color is set
by CSI 30's and/or 40's m, or in 7-bit form ESC [ 30's and/or 40's m.

	The above are in the user's manual and the distribution docs.

	If the remote host is sending material in 8-bit form to a client
which is not 8-bit compatible (and VT100's are 7-bit devices) then the high
bit is lost and confusion will result.

        I wish to emphasize that VMS knows nothing about "ANSI" terminal
kinds, so please use a kind it does recognize, such as the handy VT320,
which is an 8-bit terminal kind too.

I have found the above to be true also. The WYSE 325 will really only
allow you to define what color should be *bold* and what color should
be *reverse* and so forth. You can't really display something in *red*
or *blue* as such.

You could try a WYSE 370 terminal. These are nice terminals with dual-
session capability and full color support, but $$$$$$$$.

I have heard that the Relisys is a good terminal, but have no actual
experience.  Actually, what makes pretty good $$ sense right now is
to buy used 386-type machines with VGA & run terminal emulation as
*console* to get full color.

Just my $.02 worth.

You should get the following book:

  UNIX Curses Explained
  Berny Goodheart
  Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-931957-3

It's much better than the Nutshell you have and it also explains how to
use the color capabilities from both, curses and terminfo low level.
And it's documented in the SCO manuals, see the curses and terminfo
manual pages, the first one has a complete chapter for color capability
programming, at least in the SCO UNIX docs, don't know the Xenix ones.

I'm using Motif 1.1, so my setup may be different than yours.

Look at the file SYS$MANAGER:DECW$RGB.DAT.  This seems to define the 
various colors. names.

Instead of modifying this file directly, I would recommend that you 
copy it to a new filename, modify the copy, and then setup 
DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM to have DECW$RGBPATH point to your new 
file.

        It is, but you need to use the ANSI color escape sequences.  You
    can find these  on  any  VMS  system in SYS$SYSTEM:SMGTERMS.TXT, you
    only  need to know that a dollar-sign, $, is a "meta-character"  for
    escape, 0x1b.  Here are the foreground colors, in SMG-speak:

	black_screen = "$[40m",		blue_screen = "$[44m",
	cyan_screen  = "$[46m",		green_screen = "$[42m",
	magenta_screen = "$[45m",	red_screen  = "$[41m",
	white_screen = "$[47m",		yellow_screen = "$[43m"

    For background, use <esc>[30m --> <esc>[37m in place of the forties.
    Also, use <esc>[39m and  <esc>[49m  to  turn  off the background and
    foreground ANSI colors (i.e., put them back to the defaults).

I wouldn't bother messing with this.  Look at the warning messages very
carefully.  HINT: Notice how there is an extra space after the color names?
My guess is that you weren't very careful when you edited your resource file
and ended up with trailing spaces at the ends of the lines where you defined
those colors.  Your PC X server is probably a little more tolerant to that
sort of thing than the VAX X server.

	While I understand the efficiency aspect, "new" meaning "still wet
from painting" often strikes me as advocacy rather than compatibility.

	But if you guys would please look at MSK v3.14, under SET TERMINAL,
see ERASE, and the two options it provides: normal-background, current-color.

Or you can get an Internet copy of more (or GNU's less), and roll your own
uses of the curses library calls for character attributes.  Put the resulting
executable in your $HOME/bin/ directory, and include that in your path

(call it mymore or something).

There is a book put out by O'Reilly, in their Nutshell series, titled:
"Termcap & Terminfo".  See their web page, http://nutshell.oreilly.com/ ,
or just pick it up at any Barnes&Noble or Borders.

I learned it directly from the man pages for termcap and terminfo.  I
would look at the terminfo page first if I were you.  (I really learned it
by having to hardcode escape codes for the VT52 into several BASIC
programs I wrote in highschool, then having to make the same thing work
on a Tektronix terminal -- mostly Star Trek and football screen oriented
games in the late 1970's.  Termcap and curses just provided another way
to do the same thing.)

Just roll your own.  To quote from the terminfo(4) manpage:

    To test a new device description, set the environment variable
    TERMINFO to the pathname of the directory containing the compiled
    description you are working on and programs will look there rather
    than in /usr/share/lib/terminfo.

Use the "infocmp $TERM > ${TERM}.ti" or "infocmp xterm > xterm.ti" in
your home directory.  Edit the file as you wish, adding entries and such.
Then create a terminfo directory from your home directory, then an "x"
directory under that.  Then set your TERMINFO env. variable to:
$HOME/terminfo .  Then use the command "tic -v5 ${TERM}.ti" or
"tic -v5 xterm.ti" to compile it, and you are as good as go.

You don't need a copy of the existing TERMINFO dirs, just your one new file.

Folks,

Thanks so much for the great help. I think the problem is finally
solved. Here was the final recipe:


1) export TERMINFO=<some_existing_"permenent"_directory>
2) infocmp $TERM > ${TERM}.ti
3) add entries smul=\E[4m, rmul=\E[m, to the ${TERM}.ti file
4) tic -v5 ${TERM}.ti


Now those pesky words that used to show up as reversed (inversed?) are
the designated underline color, whereas the pager "prompt" and searching
nicely reverses (inverses?) matching words

The "man terminfo" was the additional key. I did "man termcap" and got
nothing, so, until suggested, I never tried man terminfo. So once again,
I've learnt to RTFM.

I owe ya'all!

Subject: Setting up foreground colors with termcap

Hi, I've got a little problem with making a termcap (or rather a
terminfo) entry under Digital UNIX.

I want to set the default foreground color to something other than
black. My users will have a menu displayed on their screen when they
log in to the system. Then the foreground color will change to reflect
their selection and after that the selected ASCII-based application
will start. These applications are not written by me and it plays with
ANSI codes a lot. So I was thinking of making a terminfo file for each
of the users choices. Then I would set the TERM variable and then
reset the terminal and start their application in a script. Something
like this:

export TERM=app1
tput reset (or whatever)
run application

So far I've managed to make the text red initially. But as soon as the
application starts it resets the colors to black on white. Any ideas
on how to change the default color (and make it permanent)?

I might add that when for example running "man man" with this termcap
only parts of the text will be red... So it looks like I've messed
something up, but I have no idea what...

And another thing. The terminal will only change the foreground color
after running "tset init" or "tset reset". If I do a "reset" it will
switch back to black on white.

This is my terminfo file (I compile it with "tic filename"):
(It started out as a xterm terminfo definition file)

what is the actual terminal (emulator)?

A few (such as XFree86 xterm) can change the foreground and background
colors separately from ANSI color controls (though the two do not mix --
ANSI colors override the "dynamic colors").

It depends on your emulator (I don't know).  For XFree86 xterm, I consider
it a rarely-used feature (it's there because I inherited it from someone's
earlier incorporation of features from color_xterm).

Oh, what an interesting thread. :-)  This really belongs in comp.terminals.

There is only one problem with this rationale, most of the terminal
designs were implemented in hardware and in order for software to
emulate them properly the software must do exactly what the hardware
did.

There are actually two issues that are tightly related here:

(1) what color is used for filling in erased/scrolled areas of the
    screen: "current" or "default"?

(2) what happens to the "current" color when a "reset attributes"
    command is received (ANSI X3.64-1979/ISO 6429 - CSI 0m):
    does it get reset to the "default" color or not?

These two feature choices have been implemented in different ways
because the ANSI X3.64-1979 standard (withdrawn) did not specify
how color should be used in these situations.

There are few terminals that actually implement "erase with default
color".  The QNX console is one example, older Xterm implementations
are another.  Many of the so called "ANSI"* terminals (SCOANSI, AT386,
...) implement both and can be toggled between the two modes with:

  Set Fill Mode
  CSI = Ps L
    Ps = 0, use current color
    Ps = 1, use default color

However, when it comes to the question of "reset color with attributes"
there is about a 50/50 split.  The DEC VT line of terminals and those
derived from them (Linux console, Wyse 3xx series, SNI, ...) implement
"reset colors with attributes" whereas those derived from the IBM
High Function Terminal (AIXterm, SCO Console, PCANSI, ...) do not
reset the colors when attributes are reset.

When one or both of these capabilities are implemented incorrectly in
a terminal emulator the result is similar when used with form based
applications: white space tends to be in the wrong color.  However,
the cause of the problems are very different.

Now I completely agree that "erasing with the default color" makes
screen optimization must more difficult.  However, it is a feature of
many terminals and, since terminals do not go away, it should be
supported.  'screen' implemented it years ago; while it might not be
very efficient it can't be very hard.


(*) There is no terminal called "ANSI".  ANSI never produced a terminal
    definition.  X3.64-1979 is a standard (withdrawn) that outlines
    a framework upon which terminal definitions could be built.  There
    is so much flexibility in the standard that it would be almost
    impossible for two terminal designers to come up with interoperable
    designs.

My development version of slang handles terminals that do not have the
bce capability, and it was not difficult to implement.  I was
reluctant to add support for such terminals because I do not want to
encourage their use.

Sure it does.  If I implement a terminal type that has a feature that
I think is a bad design and therefore change it to what I believe is
a better design, I am not implementing the original terminal type--
instead I am deriving a new one.  Whatever change I make is going to
affect the ability of the terminal emulation to reproduce the behavior
of the original terminal.

Most terminal software implements multiple terminal types.  If non-bce
terminals are really slow compared to a bce terminal, the user will
switch to the bce terminal.  Just as people used to switch to HZ1500
when using Emacs because the HZ1500 supported cursor size changes
whereas the VT terminals did not.

The place to put this is in the init string.  That way you will be
setting the mode to use current color at the start of your applicaiton.

That's a bug, it appears. The option works for the normal ANSI
colour-changing sequences (^[[40m ... ^[[47m), and only fails for
the strange SCO sequences you're using there, presumably because we
failed to test that particular combination. Sorry about that.

I've just checked in a fix, so tonight's snapshot ought to be an
improvement. (The fix is in r6379, so if something goes wrong
building tonight's snapshot then it'll have a revision number less
than that and you'll know the fix isn't there yet.)

Yeah, I'd love to use those, but I need 16 colors. The only way I know to
get that is with the SCO sequences.

Sorry? Umm... yeah... okay. I post a question to Usenet, mentioning a
possible bug. Five hours later you've not only verified it's a bug, but
you've also fixed it *and* updated the download site. That's what I call
service! If only commercial support was that good...

Unfortunately, I'm having a crisis at work, right now, so I can't check it
out today, but I should be able to let you know if it works later this
week.

Thanks again,

Then you might find it useful to know that PuTTY also supports
16 colours using xterm's extensions to ANSI SGR:

 - ESC[30m ... ESC[37m select the normal 8 foreground colours
 - ESC[90m ... ESC[97m select the bright versions.
 - ESC[40m ... ESC[47m select the normal 8 background colours
 - ESC[100m ... ESC[107m select the bright versions.

He might also read the manpage for tput and use that to construct the prompt
string, rather than hardcoding it (this 16-color data is in the xterm-16color
terminfo entry).

The VT220 does not have any support for color escape sequences.

The so called ANSI-BBS terminals implement a subset of the color
sequences defined in the standard document ANSI X3.64.  These same
sequences are implemented in many Unix console drivers: SCO ANSI,
AT386, Linux, ...

But the fact that a terminal does or does not support the color
sequences has little to do with whether or not two given terminal
types are compatible.  The VT terminals use a different line wrap
rules than most of the Unix consoles excluding Linux.  The SCO ANSI
and AT386 terminal drivers both support colors but have different
rules for what happens when an attribute reset command is received.
One resets the colors as if they are attributes (bold, underline, blink,
...) and the other doesn't.

The reality is that each and every terminal and console driver is
different and you need to use a emulator that understands each of
the different variations.  That is why Kermit 95 has so many terminal
definitions.

Subject: Should sgr0 escape sequence reset color?

My company produces software for UNIX that does screen handling solely
on character-based terminals or emulators (not X GUI).  We make
extensive use of terminfo and depend on it being configured correctly.

We have a current problem with certain emulators.  We make the
assumption that sgr0 should clear only the nine traditional sgr
attributes and should leave color alone.  But on dtterm, nxterm, rxvt
and xterm Xfree86 3.3.3, the sgr0 escape sequence from the terminfo
entry sets colors to the original pair.  So when we issue sgr0 to make
sure blink or dim are off, there is the unwanted effect of colors being
reset.  This behavior does not occur using aixterm with its terminfo
entry, nor on the emulator we use for development and QA testing, which
is PowerTerm (for PC/Win9x) set in its SCO-ANSI emulation mode.

Should sgr0 effect colors?  Does the ANSI standard for color terminals
have anything to say on this subject?  Why has there evolved a
disagreement in the effect of sgr0 across emulators?  Is there an
escape sequence we could use to turn off the traditional nine
attributes without effecting color?  Any comment would be appreciated.

How SGR 0 should affect color is 100% determined by the terminal type.
Some terminals say that SGR 0 should not affect color.
Others say that the color should be reset.  What should it be reset to
is also dependent on the terminal type.  Some terminals have a fixed
color combination. Others have a programable default for fg and bg.

The same is true for the erase screen functions.  Should they affect
color or not?  If yes, do they erase with the current color or the
default color?

Its all dependent on the terminal type.

ANSI X3.64/ ISO 6429 ... leave these and many other questions up to
the implementor.  These standards are style guides providing lots of
options for the terminal designer to choose from.  They are not a
fixed set of required functions.

not "16 bit color", but "16 colors"

there are two ways of interpreting the request for 16-colors - one
implements 8 ANSI colors and uses the bold attribute (or in the case
of one library, the blink attribute ;-), and calls that 2 * 8 = 16.

The other - done by aixterm and XFree86 xterm - adds control sequences
that are specified for an additional 8 colors.  That's not the same
control sequence as for bold (or blink).  So one can get 16 colors
(plus bold, etc).

PRODUCT: Wyse  WY-325

THE ISSUE:
        How to implement full color capability of the WY-325 in ASCII
        personalities - Color-associated attributes in UNIX.

OVERVIEW:
        The WY-325, in the native and other ASCII personalities, is
        capable of generating 8 combinations of foreground and
        background colors. The following is a general guide to use
        for implementing the fullest possible capability of this
        terminal to take advantage of its color possibilities.
        Available from The WYSE Technology BBS (408-922-4400), is a
        fully annotated termcap for the WY-325, along with a "SETCOLOR"
        utility and a "CHECKCOLOR" demo which uses only termcap calls
        for color. These three files are invaluable in aiding develop-
        ment work with this terminal. They should help eliminate a lot
        of the guesswork in configuring colors.

RESOLUTION:
        The best place to start, is to offer a definition of how the
        terminal generates colors. In the ASCII emulations of this
        terminal, colors are associated to display "ATTRIBUTES". An
        attribute is simply something done to certain text to make
        it "stand out" from the rest of the text (e.g. underlined,
        bolded, reversed, etc.). On monochrome terminals, attributes
        are commonly used in their literal sense: underline produced
        a line under the text, and so on. The WY-325 uses the same
        codes used to produce underscore, for example, to produce
        a unique combination of foreground and background colors.

        The WY325 terminal is designed to accommodate 32 different
        display attributes, but not all of the attribute commands
        produce colors. There are 8 colors available in the terminal,
        so only eight attributes were chosen to generate color
        combinations. Here are the colors available:

            1) Black
            2) Blue
            3) Green
            4) Cyan
            5) Red
            6) Magenta
            7) Yellow
            8) white

        These eight colors may be associated with the following chosen
        attributes:

            1) Normal Text (Attributes Off)
            2) Reverse (Blank*) Text
            3) Dim Text
            4) Dim & Reverse (Blank*) Text
            5) Underline Text
            6) Underline & Reverse (Blank*) Text
            7) Underline & Dim Text
            8) Underline & Dim & Reverse (Blank*) Text

               * Either "Reverse" OR "Blank" attribute may be selected,
                 providing for some flexibility. This is a setup feature.

        The association command that puts the three items together is:

                        Esc d y <fg> <bg> <map>

          <fg>  <bg>  (Color)     | <map>  (Attribute Association)
        =================================================================
           1     1     Black      |   1     Normal
           2     2     Blue       |   2     Reverse (Blank)
           3     3     Green      |   3     Dim
           4     4     Cyan       |   4     Dim & Reverse (Blank)
           5     5     Red        |   5     Underline
           6     6     Magenta    |   6     Underline & Reverse (Blank)
           7     7     Yellow     |   7     Underline & Dim
           8     8     White      |   8     Underline & Dim & Reverse
                                                              (Blank)
        =================================================================

        (e.g. Esc d y 8 2 1  will give a White foreground on a Blue
                             background, associated with "Normal".
                             "Normal" will affect the whole screen.
                             Note that there should be no <Spaces> in
                             the command!


        Having identified and defined all eight color possibilities does
        not automatically bring color to life in the terminal (except
        "Normal" will take affect immediately). To get a color from
        any of the association attributes, one must do the following:

        1) Call (send the Esc Sequence) the attribute (See following)
        2) write out your text for the desired length of the color.
        3) Turn off the attribute.

        The following are the Esc Sequences needed to activate the eight
        chosen attributes:

               1) Esc G 0     Normal Text
               2) Esc G 4     Reverse Text
                   (Esc G 1)   (Blank Text)
               3) Esc G p     Dim Text
               4) Esc G t     Dim & Reverse Text
                   (Esc G q)   (Dim & Blank)
               5) Esc G 8     Underline Text
               6) Esc G <     Underline & Reverse Text
                   (Esc G 9)   (Underline & Blank)
               7) Esc G x     Underline & Dim Text
               8) Esc G |     Underline & Dim & Reverse Text
                   (Esc G y)   (Underline & Dim & Blank)

                   Putting It All Together With UNIX/XENIX
                   ---------------------------------------

        Unix and Xenix termcaps are provided so that any terminal
        device with any "personality" can produce the same or similar
        results on the screen from a single application. To put it
        another way, a programmer would only have to write ONE version
        of his/her program to accommodate different terminals, rather
        than writing one version for a certain terminal and other versions
        to accommodate other types of terminals.

        Termcaps are where the terminals capabilities are stored. Each
        terminal type should have a termcap definition detailing its
        unique capabilities. What all termcaps have in common, however
        are referred to as "labels". The "labels" are defined by an
        ANSI standard and should be consistent throughout the spectrum
        of terminals available on the system.

        As an example of these device independent "labels", let's take a
        simple example. A programmer wanted to write a program to clear
        the screen. A "c" program was composed which sent his WY-325
        terminal the codes: Esc +   . This is the command which will clear
        the screen, and works very well on this terminal. The programmer
        then found an old VT-100 terminal and wanted to do the same thing.
        The VT-100 command to clear the screen is actually different than
        the one he used in the program. When the program was run, it did
        not clear the screen. A second program had to be written to do
        this. A second version was created which contained the command:
        Esc [ 2 J   , which is the correct command to clear the screen
        in VT-100 personality. It becomes apparent that there could
        be many different versions of the same program, and could be
        very confusing.

        Using termcaps, only one version of the program needs to be
        written. The clear screen commands are actually stored in
        each terminals termcap. This is how it's done:

             WY-325 Termcap        VT-100 Termcap
             --------------        --------------
             cl=\E+                cl=\E[2J

        Notice that the two commands to clear the screen are not the
        same, but these two definitions have one thing in common: the
        ANSI standard termcap label for clearing the screen is "cl".

        We would then have only to make a "call" to the termcap label
        "cl" to invoke the correct clear screen command. The program
        doesn't actually care which terminal is logged in, it just
        knows to call "cl" when it wants to clear the screen. The
        termcap that gets called from the program depends upon the
        "TERM=" variable which is set when a user logs in to the
        system. TERM directly associates the Terminal type to the
        termcap, among other things.

        When working with attributes (and ultimately, colors) in the
        WY-325 terminal, we must now look at the mechanics and
        definitions of the labels in the termcap. Here are the eight
        attributes which can be included in the WY-325 termcap and
        how they should be set up:

        Termcap Label  Description     WY325 Definition      Code
        -------------  --------------- ----------------    -------
            so         Begin Standout  Undln/Dim/Rev         \EG|
            se         End Standout    Normal                \EG0
            us         Begin Underline Underline             \EG8
            ue         End Underline   Normal                \EG0
            mr         Reverse On      Reverse               \EG4
            mb         Blink On        Undln/Rev             \EG<
            md         Bold On         Dim/Reverse           \EGt
            mh         Dim On          Dim                   \EGp
            mk         Blank On        Undln/Dim             \EGx
            me         Attributes Off  Normal                \EG0

        The line from the termcap (for attributes) would then look like:

        :so=\EG|:se=\EG0:us=\EG8:ue=\EG0:mr=\EG4:mb=\EG<    etc....

        Finally, we need to take a look at the mechanics that a typical
        application program would utilize in calling a termcap and
        invoking the codes associated with the command "label". The
        WY-325 color commands are specifically addressed in the following
        example code: (Note that this is not intended to be an exercise
        in c programming, but is presented here to show the interaction
        of the program with the termcap.)

        /* Program Sample
        # include <stdio.h>

        /* Declare Pointer Variables
        static char *IS, *CL, *ME, *MR, *MD;

                      Clear Screen      (*CL)
                      Attributes OFF    (*ME)
                      Reverse ON        (*MR)
                      Bold ON           (*MD)
        static char *ptr;
        static char *tv_stype;
        extern char *tgetstr();
        extern void tputs();

        /* Subroutine to "read" the requested "labels" from termcap buffer
        static char *
        qgetstr(ref)
        char *ref
        {
          register char *tmp;
          if ((tmp = fgetstr(ref,&ptr)) == NULL) {
            printf("/etc/termcap terminal %s must have a %s= entry\n",
                tv_stype,ref);
          }
          return(tmp);
        }

        /* Subroutine to open the termcap and read into 1024 Byte Buffer
        /* this will speed up the "lookup" process if it's loaded into mem

        static void
        tcapopen()
        {
          extern char *getenv(),*realloc();
          char *tcapbuf;
          char tcbuf[1024];
          if ((tv_stype = getenv("TERM")) == NULL) {
            printf("TERM type not defined\n"):
            exit(1);
          }
          if ((tgetent(tcbuf,tv_stype) != 1) {
            printf("Terminal type not in termcap\n");
            exit(1);
          }
          if ((ptr = tcapbub = malloc(1024)) == NULL) {
            printf("Out of memory space\n");
            exit(1);
          }

          /* get the needed "labels from the buffer.

          IS = qgetstr("is");       /* Get the initialize string

          ME = qgetstr("me");       /* Get the attribute off command
          MR = qgetstr("mr");       /* Get the Reverse ON command
          MD = qgetstr("md");       /* Get the Bold ON command
        }

        /* Subroutines to send the label's command to terminal

        static void
        ttputc(c)
        {
          fputc(c,stdout);
        }

        void
        putpad(str)
        char *str
        {
          tputs(str,1,ttputc);
        }

        main()
        {
          tcapopen();            /* open the termcap
          putpad(IS);            /* send the initialize string
          putpad(MR);            /* start reverse attribute
            printf("This is in reverse attribute mode/n");
          putpad(ME);            /* turn off the attribute
          putpad(MD);            /* start bold attribute
            printf("This is in bold attribute mode\n");
          putpad(ME);            /* turn off the attribute
        }

        The last eight lines of the sample program ( main() ) is
        a very short example, illustrating how the labels in a termcap
        are called from a program.

        This may seem like a long, drawn-out explanation of how to get
        colors on the WY-325, but the descriptions have covered many areas
        which, by themselves, would be useful to understand. They
        collectively will generate the desired colors. To summarize the
        steps necessary for color/attributes, the following are
        required in this process:

                 1) Insure termcap definitions have the necessary
                    "labels" with the proper commands for attributes.
                    (e.g. :mr=\EG4  etc.)
                 2) Send the terminal the commands to associate
                    the desired colors with the attributes.
                    (e.g. \Edy572 [red on yellow = reverse])
                 3) The application program has to call the attribute.
                    Once a particular attribute is called, the colors
                    will affect new text on the screen until the
                    attribute is turned off by the program.

                                 ###

hi all,
i have two questions  :
 1- i have an application running on AIX 5.1 wich is semi graphical.

i have an old emulator, pcconnect, on my PC to use this application.
some parts of the interface is rendered as yellow when i use pcconnect (i
want it to be yellow ...)

but when i use the integrated telnet of Win2k or XP
the yellow part is brown ....

i have tried all terminfo definitions and it is still brown ...
can anyone explain me why ????
can i modify the terminfo definition to get it yellow ???


2- to use this app with the Win2K Telnet client, i have modified the Ansi
definition in the terminfo database.
in this definition, there are values for setf and setb capabilities that are
:
setb=\E[4%p1%dm, setf=\E[3%p1%dm,

can anyone explain me, or point me to some docs to set these values  ?
( i know that \E[ is an escape character but what does 4%p1%dm mean ? )

thanks for any help ...

often bold yellow comes out as you're expecting.

I seem to recall that Microsoft's "telnet" cannot do bold colors.

% man terminfo

(your system may show a set of functions by that name, from section 3,
but there's a much longer manpage in section 4 or 5, depending on the
system).

the "4" is a literal character.

"%p1" tells the application to push the first parameter onto a stack

"%d" tells the application to pop the stack and send the decimal digits for it

"m" is literal

From the (POSIX) shell:

      $ echo normal $(tput rev) reversed $(tput rmso)

See terminfo(4) man-page for more details.

 ..............................................................................

    [The above assumes a POSIX-compliant shell, which in HPUX is what
    /usr/bin/sh provides.  To get the same behavior in Solaris, you
    need the POSIX shell supplied as /usr/xpg4/bin/sh.]

You could benefit from reading background material archived at

     http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html

By 1985, Digital Equipment Corporation was selling its VT241 video
terminal, which communicated in ASCII, complied with the ANSI X3.64
standard, and was capable of rendering text on its VR241 CRT in at
least 64 different colors, as well as rendering graphics in Sixel
and ReGIS.  (ReGIS was popular for pie charts, as I recall.)

One thing you'd miss, though, is that a VT241 did not respond to the
ISO-DP6429/ECMA-48 color control attributes in the SGR sequence as
many programmers are accustomed to today; you had to adjust the color
via ReGIS controls, as somebody did for VMS in this demonstration:

     http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/vt241_color_news.txt

(You may have heard SGR color-attribute control referred to as
"ANSI color" sequences, however, color attributes do not appear
in the ANSI X3.64 standard!  The color codes were first defined
in ISO DP6429.) 

See also...

     http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/color_control_news.txt
     http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/dec_terminals_news.txt
     http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/dec_regis_color.termcap

But today (yes, in 2005) you can call up Boundless Technologies
and order a brand-new VT525, which is a descendant of the VT241, 
but which responds just fine to ISO-DP6429/ECMA-48 controls, and
you can even get an evaluation unit for 30 days for free.

    http://www.boundless.com/Text_Terminals/VT/VT_525/

In addition, there are other terminals on the market that would also
give you color, such as the Wyse 325ES:

Wyse offers some support advice on controlling color in Unix.

Yes--the ANSI model, which doesn't specify all of the nice little details.

Agreed--the host doesn't know enough to use the terminal efficiently.

Right--smgterms.txt doesn't tell as much as termcap or terminfo would.

(I noticed this some time ago, curious to see if there was enough information
in smgterms.txt to properly treat xterm, etc., for color support in vile,
and found there was not).

Well, mostly I see different syntax.  Ignoring that, the differences are
based on the types of terminals that they're supporting.

smgterms has a few predefined items for which there is no conventional
termcap setting, e.g., (reading smgterms):

       width_narrow = "$[?3l",         width_wide = "$[?3h",

noting however, that termcap's capability list is not predefined -
applications use conventions.  terminfo usually (except for ncurses)
uses wholly predefined capabilities, like smgterms.  Most of the
data I see in smgterms corresponds 1-1 with termcap/terminfo
capabilities.  Some that do not are the names given to the vt100
line-drawing characters, e.g.,

        upper_right_corner = "k",       vertical_bar = "x",

but that's part of the ac (termcap) or acsc (terminfo) string.

smgterms has predefined names for (no surprise) the application mode of
the DEC vt100 numeric keypad:

        key_0 = "$Op", key_1 = "$Oq", key_2 = "$Or", key_3 = "$Os",
        key_4 = "$Ot", key_5 = "$Ou", key_6 = "$Ov", key_7 = "$Ow",
        key_8 = "$Ox", key_9 = "$Oy",
        key_comma = "$Ol",      key_minus = "$Om",      key_period = "$On",
        key_enter = "$OM",      key_pf1 = "$OP",        key_pf2 = "$OQ",
        key_pf3 = "$OR",        key_pf4 = "$OS",        key_down_arrow = "$[B",

So generally what smgterms has that termcap doesn't have is a lot of
names for things that apply specifically to DEC terminals.

termcap/terminfo have settings to handle cases that do not appear on
DEC terminals, e.g., (bce is the flag I mentioned before):

   back_color_erase           bce     be    Screen erased with background color
   can_change                 ccc     cc    Terminal  can  re-define existing
                                            color
   ceol_standout_glitch       xhp     xs    Standout not erased by overwriting
                                            (hp)
   has_meta_key               km      km    Has a meta key (shift, sets parity
                                            bit)
   hue_lightness_saturation   hls     hl    Terminal uses only HLS color
                                            notation (Tektronix)

I don't see any setting in smgterms that's telling the number of colors
the terminal supports.  There are some apparent afterthoughts such as

        begin_user1 = "$[30m",          end_user1 = "$[m",
        begin_user2 = "$[34m",          end_user2 = "$[m",

Comparing it only against terminfo, I don't see (at first) any indication in
smgterms that it supports expressions such as terminfo's sgr string:

       sgr=\E[0%?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;%?%p2%t;4%;%?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;%?%p4%t;5%;m%?%p9%t^N

so what I'm mostly seeing in smgterms is comparable to termcap, i.e.,
plugging in parameters based on position, e.g.,

        set_cursor_abs = "$[!UL;!ULH",          smgterms
        :cm=\E[%i%d;%dH:                        termcap
        cup=\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH,                  terminfo

But that reminds me that VT52 wouldn't work with only positional parameters.
I see this:

        SET_CURSOR_ABS = '$Y(%1+31)(%2+31)',    smgterms
        :cm=\EY%+ %+ :                          termcap
        cup=\EY%p1%' '%+%c%p2%' '%+%c,          terminfo

So smgterms does have some expression capability (not used much--I only
see it used in the VT52 and VT55).

Well, yes and no. Actually, I recall from working with my first UN*X
system that I had to create a termcap entry for the tube I was using at
the time. Don't recall the make just now, but it had an ANSI-compatible
emulation (such as it was at the time) that included having an
"application" mode for the numeric keypad. The sequences were something
like \001\003, \001\007\, \001\012\, etc.; the first character was (I
believe) a CTRL+A followed by some other control character, not
introduced by an escape.

Not sure where to find doc.'s on SMG (Screen Management Guidelines)
these days. I suspect that there are other mnemonics not included in the
SMGTERMS.TXT file, but documented elsewhere.

starting here:

        http://h71000.www7.hp.com/doc/index.html

searching for smg gives this:

        http://h71000.www7.hp.com/doc/72final/5935/5935pro.html

(from the available documentation, the parameter-substitution is not
as flexible as terminfo).
