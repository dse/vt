        However, it's unlikely  that  the  original  poster (Sujith Abey
    <sa1@Ra.MsState.Edu>) will be able to:

	$ SET TERMINAL/DEVICE=TVI925
    or
	$ SET TERM/DEV=WYSE50 

    That would require appropriate  entries  to  be added to SYS$SYSTEM:
    TERMTABLE.EXE.

        Sujith, check with your system  manager  to see whether the Wyse
    and/or   TeleVideo  terminals  have  been  added  to  your  system's
    TERMTABLE.  If not, request that it be done.  If the sysmgr says, in
    effect, "If you want it, you  do  it,"  then  read  the  section  on
    "foreign  terminal"  support in the Screen Management (SMG$) utility
    manual.  You can, in fact, make  up your own, partial termtable that
    includes  just the Wyse and the TeleVideo if you like.  Feel free to
    e-mail me if you'd like more details...but please  check  with  your
    system manager first!

=Welcome to the wonderfull intuitive world of VMS.
=Your subject line actually contains the answer to your
=question! How do you SET the TERMINAL type?
=With the SET TERMINAL command!!!
=
=SET TERMINAL can take a number of qualifiers. You can
=list them with HELP SET TERMINAL. In your case, you
=want to SET TERMINAL/DEVICE_TYPE=dev_type where
=dev_type is any one of those listed by issuing
=HELP SET TERMINAL/DEVICE_TYPE.

Unfortunately, your answer is wrong and fails to answer the original
question.  the DEVICE_TYPE can be any terminal type included in the version of
TERMTABLE.EXE your process is using.  By default, you use
SYS$SYSTEM:TERMTABLE.EXE.  You can use a version of termtable in a different
directory by defining the logical name TERM$TABLOC to point to the directory in
which TERMTABLE.EXE is found.  Now, since neither Wyse50 nor tvi925 terminal
types are defined in the standard TERMTABLE.EXE, you've got to make your own
version, which includes definitions for these terminal types.  To do that, edit
create a file in your current directory called TERMTABLE.TXT, modelled after
the files SYS$SYSTEM:TERMTABLE.TXT and SYS$SYSTEM:SMGTERMS.TXT (for a complete
description of the format of this file and what the various fields mean, see
the SMG routines manual).  You then run SYS$SYSTEM:SMGBLDTRM to compile the
text file into a .EXE file, then define TERM$TABLOC to point to the directory
in which the .EXE file provides.  At that point, you'll be able to use the SET
TERMINAL command to set your terminal to a WYSE50 or TVI925 device type.

understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below).  So
unless what I'm saying is directly related to VAX/VMS, don't hold me or my
organization responsible for it.  If it IS related to VAX/VMS, you can try to
hold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it.
