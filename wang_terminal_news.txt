Wang Terminal News

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

As of February A.D. 2000, the name "Wang" is being retired from the
computer industry by Getronics N.V., which purchased a controlling interest
in Wang/Global during 1999.

    http://www.getronics.com/

The only visible legacy of Dr. An Wang will be the Wang Center for the
Performing Arts in Boston.  (And for women of Wellesley, the Lulu Chow
Wang Campus Center.)

 ----

(Actually, as of A.D. 2002, thousands of Wang VS systems are still in
 use throughout the world, so the hardware is still visible in many
 shops.)

    Well I'm not the expert, but the 2200 terminals used 
"0xfe" and "0xff" for XON and XOFF flow control.  The 2110 
and 2110A asynchronous terminals are closer to the standards
and at least the 2110A terminal has a vt100 emulator mode.

Wow! You do have a dinosaur.  Do you fish?  You could use it
for a boat anchor or a chair to sit on.  

The "clk-slk und spkr" controls the key-klick and the speaker sound level.

The 23xx isn't a model number sequence that Wang used (to the best
of my knowledge).  Model 2236 would be correct.  The workstations
I've used from that era were 2246 and 2256 so 2236 would be possible.

I'll see what my Wang serviceman can dig out of the archives.

From your return address I would expect that the keyboard would
be in German.  :-)

Now I recognize this beast.  It was the terminal used on the
Wang 2200 computer.  The 2200 came in several sizes.  The latest
models are the 2200CS and DS.  The older ones looked like a
black metal suitcase.  It even had a suitcase handle on top.
They were amazing animals.  The CPU was made up of a couple of
74181 ALU slices, some random logic, and microcode.  It ran
<get this>  BASIC.  The machine language was BASIC.  It had
BASIC as the instruction set that was implemented in firmware.

They were amazingly fast machines.  The BASIC language had
many powerful instructions not found in any other BASIC
dialect.  They had quite a following.  Wang tried many times
to drop the 2200.  The customers protested so much that
Wang kept it in production and continued to introduce new
products for it.  The CS & DS represented a complete
re-engineering of it to modern components.

Some of the other model numbers were 2200LVP and MVP.
Multiuser systems.

The pinout of this terminal is, as far as I've done tests,
complete standard RS232.
But, the terminal can not be used as a normal terminal.
It uses the WANG emulation used on e.g. the VS5000 mini-systems.
Developed and owned by Mr Wang's company :)


Hope this helps ...

The Wang 2110 is a serial terminal whose basic command set
is VT-100.  Somewhere around here I have the DIP switch settings, too.

Forget it.  If these were the 2110 async terminals you'd be OK.
The 2110 is a superset of a VT100.

Subject: Wang 4430


I bought one of these things at the local dump for $10.  Thinking it
to be a bargain terminal, and a small waste of money if things did
not work out.  :)  However, one small question remains:

What the hell *is* this thing?

It has a pair of what I /think/ are Ethernet connectors at the back,
one is the normal socket push-and-turn affair, the other is a
screw-in style plug.  There are also two RJ-style plugs, one of which
has a picture of a keyboard above it.  (Where the keyboard plugs in,
surprise, surprise...)  Aside from the power plug, there's a switch
that operates inverse video.

Plugging this beast in works, and it will turn on, and pressing keys
on the keyboard makes that satisfying little "clicky" sound we all
love to hate.  However, since I can't get to a setup screen of any
sort, and I have no access to my Linux box (long story) I can't
discern any more information.

I've never seen a terminal that used Ethernet, but it does not seem
to be an X-Terminal, as there is nowhere to plug a mouse in...  Mind
you, a websearch yeilded a reseller's company flogging them for $80!
What gives?

Can anyone help me identify this beast, and/or tell me how to use it?

Well, no, they aren't Ethernet plugs.  Wang had its own networking system 
which required the two plugs.  At work we used to have a Wang VS before we
got our RS/6000 and all of the PCs required WLOC (Wang Local Office
Connection) cards to connect to the VS.  They ran at near 9600bps speed, and
cards had plugs exactly as you describe.  We ran a cable with the two ends
back to a Wang style hub that connected to the VS.  You could do a couple
things like file transfers that made them mildly preferable to just using
a terminal emulator over a serial connection.

I don't what the heck you would do with such a terminal outside of a
dedicated Wang shop.  All of the dumb terminals we had used serial
cables, and we can still have a couple working with the RS/6000.  Your
terminal may have a whole bunch of keys like 'Help', 'Gl', 'Cancel'
which are really helpful when running Wang software.

Wang doesn't do a whole lot of hardware sales anymore and cheap working
parts may be considered a commodity. Say if Wang is selling new terminals
with their proprietary connection for $200, getting a used one for $80 might
be a good deal for a Wang shop.  I have no idea what Wang is selling
terminals for, or if they are even are, as they have cut hardware production
way back in recent years.  There is still one VS in production last I heard.

Hi there

I am the friend

Yes we got into the setup terminal

I also have a Motorola 1-in 8-out port statmux that was used with it

I am trying to get the Wangs to communicate Via the statmux with a
Win 98 machine ( well that is the intention )

The main port on the terminal is setup for communication with a modem
and the aux port is setup for printer usage

I just collected another 2 of these terminals yesterday so hopefully
something can happen

Hi,

I am working for a client that needs to emulate a Wang VS terminal (don't 
have model specifics).

Somehow they ported the host app over to an AIX box. It is supposed to 
emulate VT102 (and so far does a pretty good job I'm told), but I can't
seem  to find escape codes for a back-tab (Shift-Tab).

Does anybody know what escape codes a Wang host would expect in order to 
receive a back-tab request?

Thanks

VT102's didn't have a separate code for shift-tab.

It is unlikely that your client "somehow ported the host app over to
an AIX box."  It is more likely that they used "COBOL ReSource" to
replatform Wang VS COBOL source code to AIX.  If that is the case,
there is no emulation of a Wang VS workstation going on, in the
strictest sense.  COBOL ReSource presents a VS-like interface via one
or another of the VT functionalities, with extensions.  VT emulators
generally have programmable keyboard maps, which is how the keyboard
is customized and how extensions are configured.

That's not relevant.  Most real Wang workstations are block-mode and
have no "escape codes."  Keys like Tab are local to the workstation and
not transmitted over the line.  Wang async workstations use an
extension of an IBM terminal protocol, but this has little to do with
COBOL ReSource, which is not a Wang VS host.  ReSource uses termcap and
curses to communicate with users running one or another of the VT-like
terminal emulators.

COBOL ReSource is a supported product.  It sounds like your client
hasn't been paying for support.  That would be the way to get the
information you seek.
