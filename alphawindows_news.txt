There are several companies selling AlphaWindow window managers.  The
ones I'm aware of are Cumulus (AlphaDesktop), JSB (Multiview/ Mascot),
Nutec (Nutec Desktop), and SSSI (FacetAlpha).  Besides window managers,
there aren't many commercial applications taking advantage of AlphaWindows
today.  Most users have an AlphaWindows window manager and use existing
character-based applications in windows.  However, at UniForum, DIA demo'd
an impressive AW medical application -- a product of Wallaby, I believe.

>enough)?

I'm not on that end of the process, so I don't know.  But I can tell you
that DIA (Display Industry Assoc) has defined an API for AlphaWindows,
and at least one of the window manager companies has written such an API.
This should make the job of programming for AW much easier.

>Will the terminal manufacturers lend terminals in order to test

I know that ADDS *will* lend terminals for compatibility testing.  I can't
speak for other terminal manufacturers, but I'd guess that any of them
would be happy to cooperate with someone writing an application targeted
for their terminal.  The current manufacturers of AW terminals are ADDS,
Cumulus, Link, Microvitek, and Televideo.

>Are the programming docs available in electronic form?

The programming information is not available electronically yet, but
will be soon.  The DIA is working on that.

If you need contact information on any of the suppliers I've mentioned,
I can provide it.

AlphaWindows-compliant terminals are readily available today from many
manufacturers (e.g. Wyse/Link, MicroVitek, and ADDS (the best, IMNSHO)).
I am not aware of any terminal-emulators for PCs that support AlphaWindows.

You are indeed right, they normally do require a host-end program to manage
the shells and such (a window manager in AlphaWindows parlance).  AlphaWindows
window managers are also readily available today for many UNIX platforms
from many manufacturers (e.g. SSSI and JSB).

The advantage of AlphaWindows is that it lets you run your current text
based applications in a motif like windowing environment without re-writing
the applications and without re-wiring your building.  I think all of the
above mentioned terminals and window managers let you run at least 6
applications simultaneously over a single line.

The following is the "scoop" on AlphaWindows.

AlphaWindows is a standard for windowing on alpha-numeric terminals.
An AlphaWindow terminal, together with a host-based window manager, provides
a mechanism for the user to simultaneously access multiple applications
over a single RS232 communication line.   The "virtual terminals" or VT's
which are running the applications are viewed through windows on the terminal
display.  The applications are completely unaware of the windowing capability
and thus require no modification.

The AlphaWindow window manager provides a menu or mouse driven user interface 
allowing the user to create, delete, move, resize, maximize, and iconify 
windows.  The user is provided with many of the benefits of a graphical
user interface (GUI) including cut and paste.  The window manager communicates 
with the terminal using a very simple protocol to manage the windows and 
multiplex VT data.  

The AlphaWindow standard was created by the Display Industry Association
(DIA) to provide a low-cost windowing solution that doesn't require
modification to applications, system upgrades, or the installation of
a network.  The standard also includes an Application Programming Interface
to allow applications to take advantage of the windowing and mouse capabilities
of the terminal.

The AlphaWindows spec is available through John Darke at the current DIA
office.  The spec is free but shipping and handling currently costs $95.
The DIA is planning on making the spec available through FTP but an electronic
version is not yet available.  The $95 includes the entire spec packaged in a
3-ring binder FedExed directly to you.  It also includes 2 years of updates.

The spec contains all the information you would need to develop AlphaWindows
products or applications.  You may talk with John Darke at (415) 967-6888 or
fax him at (415) 960-3522.

VARs may also be interested in the ADDS Developer/Integrator program.
For a limited time, this program allows them to purchase an AlphaWindows
terminal and window manager for $349.00 U.S.

The specifics are:

ADDS 4000 AlphaWindow Terminal
	VT100, VT220, VT320, PCTERM, and AT&T 605 & 705 emulations
	Two DB25 serial ports (Host and Mouse or Host and Host)
	One parallel port
	Mouse
	Keyboard
	Full documentation
	Full tech support

SSSI FacetTerm Host based window manager
	30 day free trial
	30 days of installation support
	Functional for up to 50 users
	Available on 30 different UNIX platforms
	Ability to run multiple sessions on non AlphaWindow terminals
	Full documentation

For more information about the VAR Developer/Integrator program call
1-800-442-4420 and follow Audrey Audix's instructions (I think you
dial 1 for this program).

The main difference is that it's supported by multiple vendors.

AlphaWindows does not have an error correcting protocol.  It currently
does not have host-initiated window manipulations (agent-like) but it
is being worked on.  The protocol is not limited to 7 windows like XT is.

There truly are multiple vendors starting with this standard, as Dave Jones'

The AlphaWindows protocol differs from the XT/Layers protocol mainly in
that the AlphaWindows protocol doesn't support error correction, as
Dave Dykstra mentioned.  The consortium felt that benefit/performance
degradation tradeoff of this wasn't worth it with todays communication
media.  As Dave also mentioned, the AlphaWindows standard is still
evolving and is actively supported by several software and hardware
vendors.

If you're interested in a "white paper" detailing the differences
of XT/Layers and AlphaWindows please give me a call or drop me a
line with your address and I'll send you a copy.  It is a bit lengthy
to post here.

>And what is this "industry standard" b.s.?

"Industry Standard" in that the AlphaWindows standard was developed by
a consortium of terminal vendors and software vendors.  I.E.

	Terminal			Software
	-------------			--------
	AT&T/NCR/ADDS			Cumulus
	Cumulus				JSB
	DEC				Nutec
	Link/Wyse			SSSI
	MicroVitek
	Siemens/Nixdorf
	TeleVideo

Thus one isn't dependent on a particular vendor for any part of the
solution.  If one isn't satisfied with a vendor they are free to
shop around.

"The Alpha Window product is an offshoot           [see below...ed]
of the 5620/615-620/720 development program."

I'm not sure about compatibility between the two, but many
people who worked on AT&T's 5620 program now work on ADDS's (NCR
subsidiary) Alpha Windows program.  The benefit of this standard is
much of the functionality of X windows (obviously no graphics) at a
lower cost, and it runs over regular RS-232 lines.  It's an industry
standard in that several vendors support it - it's windows on the cheap,
with no money going to those capital-W folks in Redmond.  :-)

What *I'd* like to know is, is it at all compatible with DMD/615 stuff,
or is it merely conceptually similar?

It is not at all compatible with DMD/615 stuff.  The protocol is entirely
different.  It is conceptually similar.

Well, I am a member of the DIA technical committee, and I can tell you that
I am probably the only one on that committee that takes a look at this
group occasionally.  I missed your original enquiry, but would be happy to
answer any questions you might have on AlphaWindows.  

Just a quick summary.  The DIA (Display Industry Association) has undergone
some management changes recently.  There will be a DIA booth at SCO Forum
in Santa Cruz, CA. next week along with a Birds of a Feather session on 
AlphaWindows on Wednesday night at 8 pm. The next technical meeting will be
Friday next week.

In terms of AlphaWindow products, the companies that have are shipping
AlphaWindow compliant terminals include:

  ADDS (both a monochrome and a colour pizza-box style terminal)
  Microvitek (pizza-box style colour terminal)
  Link (traditional monochrome and colour versions)
  Televideo (traditional monochrome and colour versions)
  Cumulus (monochrome terminal)
  Edisa (monocrhome terminal)
  Spike (monocrhome terminal)

At the host software end AlphaWindow compliant window managers are
available from:

  JSB (product name is Mascot)
  SSSI (product name is FacetAlpha)
 Nutec (product name is Nutec Desktop)

Being directly involved in this thing I don't think it would be my place
to review neither the hardware nor the software.  I have all the terminals
here in the office, and I also have all the window managers.  Anybody wishing
further information on individual products should contact the respective
companies.

There is an AlphaWindow Terminal Specification available and several
vendors are developing terminals that support it.  It provides much
of the look and feel of a GUI windowing environment for character
mode terminals.  A window manager on the host allows the terminal
to display multiple sessions in windows that may be opened and closed,
resized, tiled or overlapped.  It also provides mouse support and
the ability to cut and paste between windows.  Applications do not
have to know about the windowing, but may make use of the additional
capabilities.

GNU Screen 3.05 is what you are after.  It allows multiple sessions to run 
seamlessly on one terminal.  It provides a sccrollback buffer, cutandpaste,
and vt100 emulation for non-vt100 terminals.  Look for it wherever GNU 
software is found.

(I sent of copy of this via email to Karel, but the nature of the question
