xterm_news.txt

Strictly speaking, "xterm" is a terminal-emulation program that runs
within the X Windows environment.  As with most X programs, there are
many possible adjustments to its behavior.

The information archived here also mentions similar and related programs
as well, such as "dtterm".

According to 'xev', 
	F11 generates keycode 16
	F12 generates keycode 18

so
	xmodmap -e 'keycode 16 = <some keysym>'
	xmodmap -e 'keycode 18 = <some keysym>'
should do the trick

NB I am using the X11R5 Xsun X-server, so your mileage may vary
with xnews.

Subject: Re: Searching for some xterm help


According to  <lvirden@yahoo.com>:
:
:I am seeking some insight on defining an XTerm keyboard mapping problem.
:
:The problem is this - xmodmap -pk reports the following:
:
:     81         0xff50 (Home)   
:     84         0xff57 (End)    
:    102         0xffd8 (F27)    0xffd8 (F27)    0xffb7 (KP_7)   0xff50 (Home)

:
:I want to know what has to be done so that keyboard translations for
:F27 and F33 appear on the keyboard.  Right now, it appears that the
:0xff50 and 0xff57 keysyms are 'overriding' the other keysyms translation
:by default.


The solution to this was in the MIT X documentation.

The xterm translations are set from more specific to less specific.
By the time that the translations for F27 and F33 were reached, the
definitions for Home and End had already been set.  So since something
is assigning the Home and End keysyms to both pairs of keys, the first
translation took precedence over the second.

The solution was to define the F27 and F33 translations before the Home
and End ones--then I got unique sequences for the two pairs of keys
in xterm.

Perhaps this may work with NT, since suposedly Microsoft kludged some

The magic command is a text string you have to echo out.  The string is:

	ESC ] 2 ; <your-string-here> BEL

(I've added spaces for readability.)

To put this into ksh, set up an alias that does an echo on that.  I use
something that looks like (for csh):

	alias header echo -n "^[]2;\!*^G"

Where ^[ is actually an ESC character and ^G is a CTRL-G (BEL).

(I don't know the ksh equivalent.)

This is what I get when I do a man on tcsh:

      Tcsh now supports a special alias, "cwdcmd", which if set holds a
      command that will be executed after changing the value of $cwd.  For
      example, if the user is running on an X window system xterm(1), and a
      reparenting window manager that supports title bars such as twm(1) and
      has done:

            > alias cwdcmd  'echo -n "^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd ^G"'

      then the shell will change the title of the running xterm(1) to be the
      name of the host, a colon, and the full current working directory. A
      more fancy way to do that is:

            > alias cwdcmd 'echo -n "^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd^G^[]1;${HOST}^G"'

      This will put the hostname and working directory on the title bar but
      only the hostname in the icon manager menu.  Note that if a user
      defines cwdcmd to contain a cd, pushd, or popd, command, an infinite
      loop may result.  In this case, it is the author's opinion that said
      user will get what he deserves.


I hope this helps,
Henry

You can use ESC as prefix instead of a meta key.  If you use
8-bit-characters this is what you have to do in an xterm, since Meta
would add a high bit and make M-d and ä (a-umlaut) undistinguishable.
This problem has been solved in a neat way for Linux, where the
alt-key produces exactly this ESC prefix and thus works well even if
8-bit-characters are used.  I don't see any real advantage in using
the meta-key instead of the ESC-prefix though.

I suspect your xterm is `eating' the Alt thing.  You can configure
xterm so that M-x is transformed to ESC x before being sent to the
program.  I think it's the eightBitInput resource.

An xterm has support for 8-bit character input and output but I suspect the
shell you are using is stripping off the high bit from input handed to it from
the xterm process BEFORE it passes it on to emacs.  To get around this you
need to tell xterm to convert Meta characters to two-character escape
sequences which emacs will interpret as if they were Meta characters.  Here's
the appropriate X resource description from the xterm man page:

     eightBitInput (class EightBitInput)
             If true, Meta characters input from the keyboard are presented
             as a single character with the eighth bit turned on.  If
             false, Meta characters are converted into a two-character
             sequence with the character itself preceded by ESC.  The
             default is ``true.''

Just set is as follows:

  XTerm*VT100.eightBitInput:	false

in your .Xdefaults file (or equivalent file).

Yes there is a software to do that called "xkeycaps".
It enables you to redefine all the keypresses of your keyboard
and handles a lot of common keyboards.

Hummingbird's "eXceed" does a very good job but is a little pricey. If
you want a freeware version from these folks try to get "xwindemo.exe"
from some of the FTP sites around. If anybody is interested and can't
find it, contact me and I'll try to post some more info on a site. The
version I have may be outdated but does a good job over modem, ISDN,
or Ethernet. Be advised though that X over a modem can be very slow
indeed. I don't even use it much with my ISDN. The commercial packages
like "eXceed" and X-link are probably faster though.

The company info for "xwindemo" is :

As another reply pointed out, Sun's cmdtool has some nice features
that break a lot of other things.  If you use xterm (with
or without a scroll bar) all these features work fine.  Note
that you can also use ^P/^N in place of up/down arrows in tcsh,
as well as whatever up/down line commands supported by the
editor your emulating (emacs or vi).  This feature, as well
as file completion works better in xterm as well.

You can still get programs confused about the size of your terminal
with xterm, particularly after a telnet.  eval `resize` works
on a lot of systems to correct this.  I don't know about less -
I've hardly used it.  I almost never use more any more either -
my xterm scroll bar works! (more or less :)

When we moved from SunOS to Solaris, I noticed the new behavior.  I
found a terminfo description with the missing "smcup" and "rmcup"
entries.  Using that description instead of the default one gave us
back the "restoring" behavior.

Here is the "xterm" description I've been using:

I am not sure if this is what you are looking for, but try the +sf option
(turns off Sun Function Keys) on the xterm.


There is a fairly tedious, but useful, way to remap keys in the .Xdefaults
or app-defaults/XTerm file.  I recall it looks something like:


decxterm*VT100.Translations:  #override \n\
           <Key>F1:   string("0x1b") string("0q")    \n\

and you start your xterm as 

         xterm +sf -name decxterm ----- &

but I have been in a VAX-free environment for two years now and I might not
be remembering this completely.

Hope this helps.

Excerpts from the OpenVMS FAQ:
------------------------------

DECW3.  How can I get the information from SHOW DISPLAY into a symbol?

Use the undocumented SHOW DISPLAY/SYMBOL, and then reference the symbols
DECW$DISPLAY_NODE,  DECW$DISPLAY_SCREEN, DECW$DISPLAY_SERVER and/or
DECW$DISPLAY_TRANSPORT.

                                        [Fairfield@Slac.Stanford.Edu]

------------------------------------------------------------

DECW4.  How do I get a log of a DECterm session?


If you are working from a Decterm, you can use the AutoPrint feature. Choose
the "Printer..." menu item from the "Options" menu, set the printing
destination to the name of the file you want, and set "Auto Print Mode".
You are now free to continue.

It should be noted that ALL the characters and escape sequences are captured,
but if you display the log file on a DECterm you will get EXACTLY what you had.

------------------------------------------------------------

DECW5.  Problem - the DELETE key deletes forward instead of backward!


This has to do with Motif's virtual bindings.  When a Motif application starts
up, it looks at the vendor string returned in the display connection
information and attempts to match the string to a table of virtual bindings.


You can override the default bindings in your decw$xdefaults.dat file. Here is
the entry you would make to get the default VMS bindings.

DECW9.  How do I set the title on a DECterm window?


If you are creating a new DECterm window, check

HELP CREATE /TERMINAL /WINDOW_ATTRIBUTES.


If you want to change the title of an existing window, use the following
control sequences, where <esc> is the ANSI escape code, value decimal 27, and
<text> is what you want to display:


To set the DECterm title, send <esc>]21;<text><esc>\
To set the icon label, send    <esc>]2L;<text><esc>\

For example, DCL to display "My DECterm" in title bar:

$ ESC[0,8]=27
$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "``ESC`]21;My DECterm``ESC`\"

                                        [p_lee@decus.ch]


You can also change the title and the icon using the Options-Window...
menu.

xterm supports escape sequences to set the window title and/or icon name.

\e ] 0 ; iconname-and-title \7
\e ] 1 ; iconname \7
\e ] 2 ; title \7

	That's correct, WP is using the soft characters supported on real VT
	terminals. It's an impressive implementation... one can even display
	Russian characters on a character-cell terminal!

	Unfortunately, DEC didn't implement soft characters in their DECterm
	software. Why, I don't know, but I'd like to hear from someone in
	Digital about this.  Will soft characters ever be implemented in
	DECterms?

I wouldn't bet on it.

Soft characters are defined as bitmaps.  They are tied to the exact cell size
of the terminal, and sometimes to specific layout details.  (Some older
terminals, at least, would duplicate certain rows or columns as a way to get
"richer" characters without having to allocate space for them.)  Hence, any
particular soft characters you define are specific to the particular terminal.
For a DECterm, you'd have to define a whole set of characters for ... well,
for *what*?  For a DECterm, *everything* is soft:  You can use any font you
like.  (Well, any fixed-width font that contains the proper characters at
least.)  The cell sizes will vary.

Given an X-window-based system, there are much more flexible and powerful ways
to use alternate fonts if you want them.  The potential payoff from providing
the facility in a DECterm window isn't very high, and the problems involved
could be complex.  (A "real" terminal is controlling the font-to-screen stuff
entirely by itself; a DECterm, on the other hand, is letting X do that stuff.
So it's not so easy to just shove in some new characters.)

None of this is to say that such a facility *couldn't* be provided, or that it
might not be handy in some (probably quite rare) circumstances.  But my bet is
that the demand just isn't there to justify the necessary effort.

--4)    Can I use Sun's AnswerBook under X11R5(6)?

        AnswerBook in its current form requires the Openwindows
        server. It uses the NeWS/Display Postscript extensions
        to this server to display the Answerbook files.

        To use AnswerBook under X11R5 you will need to replace the 
        docviewer program with program that calls Ghostscript to view
        these pages.  A replacement docviewer can downloaded from
        ftp.ece.uc.edu [129.137.8.99] as

            /pub/sun-faq/Source/docviewer.tar.gz

        This kit contains more than one  docviewer. Try using
        the one in the toplevel docviewer directory.

        This replacement docviewer does not support all the options that
        the "real" docviewer supports such as "hypertext" links.

        To install the replacement "docviewer" you will also need 
        Ghostscript 2.4 or above and Ghostview 1.3 or above both of
        which are available from prep.ai.mit.edu in the
        /pub/gnu/ directory.

        This replacement docviewer is reported to work with all versions
        of AnswerBook but not as well as the original :).
         
        (searching and hyperlinks don't work)

What can I've done wrong when I get this behaviour?

Logged in "normal" user in Gnome I do "xhost +"
then I su -, bash and export DISPLAY=localhost:0

But every attempt to bring up a window as root gives "Can't open
display". Then I do export DISPLAY=:0 and now it works to get a window
up as root. I've done this a million times on thousands of installations
before and it has always worked. So, my fingers must have slipped
somewhere but I can't figure out where... ;-) Is it a IPv6 thing and the
first row in /etc/inet/hosts "::1     localhost" ???
Doesn't help to just remove that line...

Which version of Solaris did you install?

"DISPLAY=:localhost" uses a TCP/IP connection; in newer Solaris releases,
TCP/IP listening for the X server is disabled
(recent Solaris Nevada builds, from build 42 onwards)

With "xhost +" people could connect from everywhere and look at the
passwords and such you typed and information on the screen.

So this change is for the good.

Instead of doing "xhost +" you should try doing:

        xhost +SI:localuser:root

(allows connections from root on the local system only; and yes,
we *can* tell this with 100% accuracy in Solaris 10 and later)

And yes, you should set the DISPLAY to :0; that is the canonical name
for the loopback interface (X will select the "fastest" connection)

   xhost +SI:localuser:root works perfectly

In some environments this works:

        % stty rows 50 ; stty columns 90

If this is the resize from X11, that will not work.

        % eval `resize`

It sends an escape sequece to the terminal and the terminal returns
the size. Then it creates commands for csh or $SHELL (depends on the
version of resize) and outputs them. The eval then evaluates the
commands. It may do the stty reset as well, I don't know.

Many implementations allow "mere mortals" to specify their own
terminfo database directory with the $TERMINFO env variable. I've
done this extensively under HP-UX which has a handy untic command
to decompile existing terminfo stuff. The TERMCAP env varible can
contain a database entry for the current terminal in many
implementations.

You're experiencing bug 4843340:

4843340  patch 105181-34 /kernel/strmod/ptem returns EINVAL for TIOCGWINSZ ioctl

What this means is, the programs runnning on Solaris 2.6 (like vi)
perform a function call to find out the window size in rows and columns.

When you're on a pseudo-terminal such as when telnetting or ssh-ing,
the kernel /kernel/strmod/ptem module handles the function call.

The kernel patch 105181-34 broke that function call in the ptem module.
Now, instead of returning the correct window size, the function call
returns an error.

Different applications handle this in different ways.  Some assume the
screen size of the original VT-100 terminal is the correct size (24
rows and 80 columns).  Others do other things.

Sun is working on the fix for the problem, but I haven't heard when
it will become available.  Meanwhile, there are three potential
workarounds:

  1)  Some people have defined their terminals as "xterm" and had
      things work better for them.  This might not work for everyone,
      however.  (the bug says defining the terminal type as "vt100"
      is the workaround, but that's incorrect)

  2)  Back out kernel patch 105181-34 and reboot.  This will restore the
      previous version of the /kernel/strmod/ptem file, which didn't have
      this problem.  This might not be possible or desirable for everyone,
      though.

  3)  Copy the /kernel/strmod/ptem file from another Solaris 2.6 machine
      that has not yet been patched with 105181-34, then reboot.  This
      will restore the one broken file while allowing you to enjoy the
      other bugfixes in 105181-34.  This can be done as long as you have
      another 2.6 machine available (unpatched), or you can retrieve the
      /kernel/strmod/ptem file from a backup tape made before you applied
      patch 105181-34.

If you are using the plain X Consortium xterm (rather than the one I've
been working on), it still won't be a vt220, since the vt220 recognizes
a number of escape sequences (e.g., SGR 22) that the quasi-vt100 standard
xterm doesn't.

The XFree86 3.3 xterm supports ANSI color and VT220 emulation

I am running Triteal CDE on a RH 5.0 Linux box and dtterm, IMHO, is very
good and just as fast as xterm or color-xterm. It also has features that
xterm doesn't.

Some features (the popup with the help panel), true.  But for a fair
comparison, you ought to compare against things that are current.

(X Consortium's not done any significant recent development on xterm,
but we've done that in XFree86)

The XFree86 3.3.2 xterm supports ANSI color and VT220 emulation

I hope you have solved the problem with the font server as suggested by 
Steve and Greg. I had a similar problem with eXceed (PC Xserver) trying
to connect to our AIX. When I specified the font server in the eXceed 
configuration, the problem was solved.

My setting in exceed is
server 		: our AIX server (font server )
Transport	: TCP
Port		: 7500 ( Normally font servers use 7000 )
Catalogue	: all ( i dont understand this entry )

Good Luck

If you install PHNE_11017 on a 10.20 system, and also some filesets from
the s300 media for 9.10, then your s300 machines can be used with HP-UX
10.20.  .   For more information see:


"Interoperability Guide for HP-UX 9.x/10.x" (part number 5964-1370) 
"Updating to HP-UX 9.10" (part number B1864-90101).

The idea is that a s300 machine can boot from a s700 or s800 10.20 server 
as a special kind of diskless client.  The s300 gets a special executable 
(kernel) that turns it into an X Terminal.  It is a good way to get some
additional value out of your s300 hardware when all your s700/800 systems
have moved to 10.x.

Try 

xterm -ls 

That means LoginShell. Normaly you can tell the X to start xterm
always with -ls. It is made by adding the line 
XTerm*loginShell: true
in your .xdefaults or .xresources and xrdb -merge .xresources

A Better Terminal Emulator for X

  From the README file distributed with xterm:
 
  +-----
  |              Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here

  | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
  | ...
  +-----
 
  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See
  below.
 
  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),
 
 
1) Xvt
   Suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk)
   Author: John D. Bovey (jdb@ukc.ac.uk)
   Available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z
 
   [From the README file] "Xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is
   designed to be more or less compatible with xterm while using much
   less swap space.  It is mainly intended for use at sites which use
   large numbers of X terminals but may also be useful on single
   workstations that are short of memory.  On a [SunOS 4.1.* Sparc], an
   initially invoked xvt uses about 1/3 megabyte of swap while xterm
   uses about 1.3 megabytes (obtained by running pstat rather than ps
   which seems to give unreliable size figures on SPARCs).  The main
   way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use of the X
   toolkit.

   Since it is a partial 'clone' of xterm, you don't have to rename
   your resources, as xvt pretends to be "XTerm".  In its current
   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any
   yet.
 
   UPDATE (Oct 1993):  John Bovey tells me that a new version of xvt is
   in the works that should have some of the most frequently missed
   xterm features.
 
   There have been some conflicting opinions aired over xvt vs. xterm.
   Different sites with different needs will likely have to do
   their own evaluation.  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
 
   I have seen hard data from J.Bovey showing how xvt does in fact
   require less swap space than xterm.  However, both of us would still
   like to see any other benchmarks that people can provide comparing
   the two.  (eg: How much RAM each occupies, relative speed of each.)
 
2) rxvt
   Suggested by: Zack Evans (zevans@nyx.cs.du.edu)
   Author: Rob Nation (nation@rocket.sanders.lockheed.com)
 
   Originally a stripped down Linux port of xvt, with some 
   minor modifications, I'm now told that this program has
   been updated several times.   
 
   John Henders (jhenders@stdismas.wimsey.com):
     Here's a comparison of memory usage between xterm and rxvt on
     linux. As a bonux, rxvt scrolls text about 10X faster than an
     xterm as well.

Use /etc/dt/config/Xconfig and put something like this in it:

You have to edit the file $HOME/.dtprofile and add the line

SESSIONTYPE=xdm

If you insert this line, the users .xsession file is sourced during login.

Ok, thanks, I did that, now I type:

$xfd -fn "-dt-interface user-*-*-normal-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

and this works, I get a window show up, with this at the very top:

-B&H-LucidaTypewriter-Bold-R-Normal-Sans-19-190-75-75-M-110-ISO8859-1

Which when I create an xterm using the above as its font (i.e. xterm -fn ...)
it comes up with what looks like the same font I had on my earlier xterm,

but much larger size. So I changed the number '19' above to '10' and it can't
find size 10 (or 12).

The intersting thing, is when I want to start emacs using that same font,
I get an error that font is not defined:

$emacs -fn
"-B&H-LucidaTypewriter-Bold-R-Normal-Sans-10-190-75-75-M-110-ISO8859-1"

Font `-B&H-LucidaTypewriter-Bold-R-Normal-Sans-10-190-75-75-M-110-ISO8859-1' is
not defined

But when I do

$xterm -fn
"-B&H-LucidaTypewriter-Bold-R-Normal-Sans-10-190-75-75-M-110-ISO8859-1"
xterm:  unable to open font
"-B&H-LucidaTypewriter-Bold-R-Normal-Sans-10-190-75-75-M-110-ISO8859-1", trying
"fixed"....

xterm is smart to try 'fixed' ?

any way, I am all confused now. it looks like that font with size '10' is
not there. and the one it told me what I had on dt is too large. (the size 19)

any way, thanks for the help, I give up, X is too hard :( it should not be
this hard to find what font one is using!

Paul Williams did point to the answer you were looking for.

If the FAQ phrases the answer in a way that is too complicated,
try this very simple shell script, which is named "title":


    #!/bin/sh
    #
    printf "\033]0;$1\007"


If you invoke this as

    $ title 'Red Sky'
 
then your xterm will be entitled 'Red Sky'.

You can use :

xterm -geometry 80x12+0+0 -T "title" -e  ssh/slogin machine.xxx.xxx.xx  &

[Archiver's Note:]

Here follows a section of code I put in my ~/.cshrc file (Solaris)
or my ~/.tcshrc file (Mac OS X) to make the terminal-screen title
always reflect the current connected machine and working directory,
on whichever desktop I'm using.  (It also indicates a root session.)
The script could probably be improved.  Anyway, this works.

It should be, but more often the string terminator is ^G than ESC \

Sorry, I made it confusing. I need to do these things at the same time:
- translate chars from one encoding to a different one.

- support standard ANSI F-key mapping.

It is not much important which program does it. It could be xterm, it
could be another X program, it could be console telnet-like program
(best solution). It should not be on the system level, because I only
need char encoding translation when connecting to that particular host.

terminfo.src looks terribly complicated to me. Any easier way?

But there is no "standard ANSI F-key mapping"

The terminal (or emulator) which you are running is what determines the
type of terminal, not the host.

> terminfo.src looks terribly complicated to me. Any easier way?

terminfo.src is just a lot of terminal entries.  Use infocmp to display one,
tic to modify.

it won't make your emulator send the right F-key control strings.

(if your application is running on another host, changing ncurses won't
change anything).

Followup:

I went back to the redbook ("Networked Applications on OS/390 Unix",
SG24-5447-00) and reread the sections relating to X tools. They indeed
had a pointer to an OS/390 native xterm implementation (source and
executable) at

   ftp://grateful.rtpnc.epa.gov/public/xterm/

It looks like I have to reread the manual in detail <vbg>

You may create a socketpair, fork, set the socket as stdin/stdout/stderr,
and then exec

    xterm -S//0

for letting xterm read its output from stdin and send key presses to
stdout (hence you can send to and get data from the other end of the
socketpair).

you're probably using xterm (which maintains two screens, denoted "normal" and
"alternate" - some people use terminal descriptions which switch to the
alternate screen when running fullscreen applications such as curses - and some
dislike the feature).

it's independent of curses/ncurses

In .Xdefaults or the XTerm file in the app-defaults dir:

XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \
        <Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\
        <Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
 
To go from xterm to mailtool (as an example):

1) Highlight with left mouse button
2) Press copy
3) move mouse to mail tool
4) Press Paste

To go from mail tool to xterm:

1) Highlight as in openwindows
2) Press copy
3) Move mouse to xterm
4) Press the middle mouse button

Anybody know how to do this for xedit? xless?

Truss is your friend. `truss xterm' will show you where xterm is looking
for its defaults. On my 5.7 machine it trys a number of places and
finally finds /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/XTerm.

Are you using xauth security?  If so, the other user's ~/.xauthority file
won't contain the key that allows him to open windows on your display.  You
can use "xauth list" before logging in as the other user, and then "xauth
add <paste data>" after logging in.

PROBLEM:  xterm -e pops up a window that immediately disappears

EXPLANATION:

xterm -e <command> pops up a window, but the window disappears.  How do I use
this option for xterm (or cmdtool, shelltool, or dtterm)?

The -e option creates an xterm (or cmdtool, shelltool, or dtterm) window
which will only run as long as the thing you execute with the -e runs.  In
the case of commands like ls and date, it will exit immediately after the
commands are finished executing.  You can make the xterm stay up longer if
you run a command or script that requires user input (like telnet or ftp) or
that sleeps for a while.  For example, create the following script and make
it executable:

#/bin/sh
echo enter your name
read name

Then run xterm -e <name of script>

The xterm will stay open until you enter your name and press return.  Then it
will exit.

Subject: Small DECterm Font & DECwindows Fonts

I am looking for a small DECterm font that I can use on OpenVMS 7.2 Alpha,
so I can fit a whole DECterm into a 640x480 VNC window. I tried using the
default small font (-DEC-Terminal-Medium-R-Normal--14-*-*-*-*-*-*) but it is
a little bit too big. Whenever I tried any smaller size of that font, I got
an error saying it wasn't available. I tried "fixed", and the size is fine,
but it doesn't support the special DEC fonts. Is there a smaller font I
could use (12 point of the DEC terminal font would definitely work)?

My next question is, where do fonts come from? My DECwindows display is set
to a Linux machine, but even when I enter fonts that are available on that
machine (the 12 point DEC terminal, for example, is available and usable
from the Linux machine) I get an error if they're not available. Typically,
in the Unix world, the font comes from the server side, not the client side,
but here they seem to be coming from the the client side. Is this indeed
true by default, and how can I change it?

Thanks,
Terry

Subject: Re: Small DECterm Font & DECwindows Fonts

Yes, the fonts live with the X Server just like in Unix.  On the VMS side,
they are stored in SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSFONT...].  Unix and VMS use the same
font file formats, so if you want to transfer fonts back and forth, you
may do so.  I didn't have the DEC terminal fonts on my Linux X server, so
I copied then from the VMS machine to a directory on my Linux box and
added the directory to my font path.

Fonts are server side entities.  So when set display to the Linux box, the
font comes from the Linux box.  DECterm may want a font with specific naming
conventions (as well as specific characters in specific places).

No, you parsed that wrong (it didn't help that I wrote it unclearly) -
all the bits that are from the standard X11 distribution are still
there, they are no longer considered part of OpenWindows, and not part
of the EOL.  xterm is not only alive and well, it's been updated to
support multibyte character sets, so you no longer need hacks like kterm
for Asian locales.

(General rule, with some exceptions: *tool are gone, x* are not.)

Q: What are the differences between aixterm and dtterm?

A: The aixterm was written as a high function terminal (HFT) emulator.
   Therefore, aixterm supports escape sequences and control codes common to
   the HFT.

   The dtterm is specifically a DEC VT220-like terminal emulator
   with extensions such as color support. Also dtterm is based on the
   terminal emulator widget library "libDtTerm" which can be used in adding
   a terminal emulator window to a GUI.


http://www.developer.ibm.com/tech/faq/individual/0,,2%3A14915,00.html

Q: How do you cut and paste from an aixterm graphics window?

A: Hold the right mouse button down and drag it across the text you would
   like to copy. Then use the middle button to paste the text you just copied.

This would suggest that whatever you are using for a terminal

C-Kermit has a manual that explains this stuff in great detail,

character-set the remote host uses for French to whatever
character-set your terminal emulator uses.

For color, your terminal emulator (blah tool) has to support
it and the host needs to be told what kind of terminal you have
and needs to have a termcap/terminfo entry that knows about its
color capabilities AND applications that use that
termcap/terminfo (e.g. color ls) to do color presentations.

Are you setting your terminal type correctly on the other end?  It

The command

  $ stty columns 132

will change it on the host side.  There isn't a standard way to send
the command sequence to request that the terminal automatically switch
as well, though.

The VMS DCL command  "SET TERMINAL/WIDTH=132" does two things:

 (1) set the operating system's opinion of the terminal's width to 132 columns

 (2) send an Escape sequence that causes a DEC VTx00 terminal to configure its
     screen buffer to actually display 132 characters horizontally

The above Unix command "stty columns 132" performs only (1).

For thing (2), while there is no "de jure" ANSI standard for switching the   
visible screen width, there is yet a widely implemented mechanism, based    
on the control codes implemented  in the DEC VT220 video terminal (and in
later DEC terminal products).

If "xterm" is being used, then the "Allow 132/80 Column Switching" option must
be enabled from the "VT Options" menu.  (This screen menu is accessed by holding
down the Control key and pressing the middle mouse button.)  Then some software
running on the Unix host can cause (2) to happen by sending the DECCOLM Escape
sequence:

    Esc [ ? 3 h

In Solaris, the "some software" may consist of this simple shell command:

    $ printf "\033[?3h"

The control sequence to reset/clear the screen size back to 80 columns is:

    Esc [ ? 3 l

so the 80-column shell command is:

    $ printf "\033[?3l"

(where 'l' is a lowercase 'L').

Finally, you must reset the operating system's opinion to 80 columns like this:
 
    $ stty columns 80

Recent releases of Solaris have included Sun-supported versions of  
both "xterm" and "dtterm".  However, with Sun moving away from the
committee-compromise "Common Desktop Environment" and toward the 
Gnome windowing environment, the CDE "dtterm" program is becoming   
less important.  (And "cmdtool" is even further out of mind, whereas
Gnome Terminal is becoming more important.)

Noting that Shiva said merely "a terminal emulator", it is not clear
what software is being used.  Possibly it could be some program
running under Windows and not any of the above Unix/Linux packages.
(I picked "xterm" because it is fairly typical of a decent VT100
emulator.)

But, you do raise an issue that I forgot.  By default, the Solaris  
"dtterm" program will ignore the DECCOLM control sequence.  However,
there is an invocation option to make "dtterm" honor DECCOLM, which
the user can choose like this:
    
    $ /usr/dt/bin/dtterm -132

(In Solaris 8 and 9, this is documented in the dtterm man page.)

Another variant control sequence was developed by Digital Equipment   
Corporation for its real DEC VT330 terminals (and is used in later DEC
and/or Boundless terminal models and faithful emulators of them).  To
support multiple screen-page memory in the terminal, DEC invented a      
more generalized screen-sizing feature: the command sequence is called
DECSCPP (DEC Set Columns Per Page).

For switching to 132 columns, the DECSCPP sequence (without the
intervening spaces) would be:
    
    Esc [ 1 3 2 $ |

(Using a Unix shell command to emit the '$' dollar and '|' pipe  
characters, without interpreting them, can require tricky quoting.) 

To reset/clear the VT330 to the default of 80 columns, any of these
work:

    Esc [ $ |
    Esc [ 0 $ |
    Esc [ 8 0 $ |

According to the documentation, the VT330 also supports an analogous
DECSLPP (DEC Set Lines Per Page) control sequence, to allow screen  
pages containing 24, 36, 72, or 144 (!?) lines.

    Esc [ 2 4 t
    Esc [ 3 6 t
    Esc [ 7 2 t
    Esc [ 1 4 4 t

 ...RSS

 ..............................................................................

The special "dtterm" control sequence to set a CDE dtterm window to
24 lines and 132 columns would be

    Esc [ 8 ; 2 4 ; 1 3 2 t

or as a Solaris shell one-liner:

    $ printf "\033[8;24;132t"

(as tested using Solaris 8.)

Alan:

I was recalling one of your postings - but checking now, I'm misquoting it. 
The posting commented that "dtterm" had been modified to use a SolarisIA
extension (makes subprocesses get a priority boost), but went on to say that
"xterm" was not modified.  This was in April 2002.

you can change the strings sent by xterm's function-keys (cursor keys, etc).
using the translations resource (describe in the xterm manpage).

It sounds like you are doing "su" rather than "su -". Xlib will attempt 
to find a cookie first in $XAUTHORITY (identifing a specific file) then 
$HOME/.Xauthority. With neither variable defined, the cookie will not be 
identified and the connection to the X server refused.

xtermS is Xterm - SMALL.

The terminfo for the standard xterm tries to act as though your screen is 
65 lines long.  That frequently doesn't work for obvious reasons.  xterms 
uses only 24 lines as I recall.

for any other detail of the differences, you should be able to look at the 
terminfo entries directly using infocmp (or even "diff" the two terminfos
with it).

right, but the screen size in terminfo is supposed to be overridden by
the rows/columns info available through an ioctl on the terminal
device.  An xterm knows how big it is and sets the ioctl accordingly..

I probably gave a general-purpose answer: termcap entries are generally
limited to 1023 bytes.  The termcap I made for xterm is a compromise between
function-keys and color (gets color and as many function keys will fit).

I have a copy of Eterm 0.9 handy, and am looking at its termcap - see
two obvious problems (it contains two entries, one is "xterm", the other
inherits from that and ansi-pc-color and is called "xterm-color" - but
"ansi-pc-color" is not defined there, and the "xterm" entry is too long).
Seeing the comment about 0.9.1, I got a copy of that, and see that its
termcap only defines "Eterm".  In neither case does the termcap entry
specify the color capabilities (the terminfo files do though).

It may be documented but I see no indication how to connect this:

       colorBD (class ColorBD)
               This  specifies  the  color to use to display bold
               characters  if  the  ``colorBDMode''  resource  is
               enabled.

to the actual entry: *VT100colorBD:

Further, according to what I see in man xterm, this must be set first:

       colorBDMode (class ColorMode)
               Specifies  whether  characters   with   the   bold
               attribute  should be displayed in color or as bold
               characters.  Note that setting  ``colorMode''  off
               disables all colors, including bold.

It isn't here.  At least not in .Xdefaults

Nor is the command line switch:  +bdc
ps wwaux output shows no such flag

Yet the *VT100colorBD:  white still works.
I didn't see a mention of this being default.

perhaps it's set in the system app-defaults.  Redhat does that.  Try
        appres XTerm
to see.  I suppose a good packager would also update the manpage to
reflect their local customizations.

Thanks .. The "appres" command is easy to forget about for some reason.

Yup, it appear both the Mode and the color White are preset.
Entering a dummy account with no .Xdefaults or .Xresources:

[exp@reader exp]$ appres XTerm | grep BD
*VT100*colorBDMode:     on

Sure:

        xterm -fg rgb:ff/00/00 -bg rgb:00/00/ff -e more /etc/termcap

By the way, "man X" will give you information "rgb:xx/xx/xx" and
other similar color specifications not involving proper names.

no

It's been a known issue for some time.  Coincidentally, someone sent
a fix for it last week, and is in patch #171.

The XFree86 xterm supports ANSI color and VT220 emulation

pine's a bad example for Solaris (unless it's been radically rewritten,
it's basically a legacy BSD program - rather ugly to build).  Look at
mutt which uses the mouse interface in either ncurses or slang.  There's
some mouse code in Solaris curses, but I don't know if it works since the
documentation was discarded long ago for some reason.  You can see the
definitions in curses.h, though.

well, if it's not function of application, is it possible for application
to tell its attached terminal to disable copy/paste temporarily ? 

for example, you can't use mouse to do copy/paste in 'sun-cmd' terminal.

my question is related to 'xterm'.

I don't understand the terms you are using.
Copy/Paste is implemented by the Xterm program.

I don't know what  you mean by the attached  terminal unless you  mean
keyboard or mouse sequences you can generate there.

Whats the "application"?

Maybe if we knew *why* you want to do this?

You will never achieve that in a curses-based program.  Even if
you find a way to tell xterm and all other terminals not to allow
it, I can still take the source code to xterm and write a version
that behaves identically except that it always allows copy/paste
even if the application running on the terminal tells it not to.

In reality, I'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way anyway.  I believe
the copy/paste is done in the X server itself, not the application.

Copy/paste are controlled in xterm by resource settings (it's hardcoded
in some other applications).

Not exactly - the client (xterm for instance) asks the X server to
store the selected text after accepting a mouse button event (see the
translations resource); the paste happens in response to a binding for
the mouse buttons also.

So the copy/paste do involve the X server, but the client is the one
directing the activity.

Well, something like:

#! /bin/ksh
MYPATH=/path/to/my/bin/directory:/path/to/my/script/directory
MYCMD="myscript args..."
export PATH="/usr/bin:/usr/X/bin:/usr/openwin/bin:${MYPATH}"

if [ "${ConsoleXuser}" = "${LOGNAME}" ]; then
    xterm -display :0 -e ${MYCMD}
else
    print -u 2 -r - \
        "User $LOGNAME not console X user at this time; script not run"
fi


...(in another script, itself run from cron) might work.

But if [the operation] doesn't actually require human judgment, but
is merely a sticking point of the program being run that it expects
terminal input, [then you should] scrounge and use "expect"
(http://www.sunfreeware.com/ has it precompiled, I think)
which uses pseudo-ttys to communicate with a program and can script its
interaction with that program.

That is, unless the program itself is something that needs an X display
for input, "expect" should be quite able to get around its inability to
deal with <<EOF input.

The class overrides because most of the colors use the Foreground class.

I know about that, but it was part of the design that I inherited back in
1996 - puzzling but not annoying enough to alter.

OK, then if someone has XTerm*Foreground then they also need to

Subject: Re: xterm v. xterm-old


Mmmm, yes.  xterm window seems to be using the foreground declared in
the x terminal resources for the background reverse video.

For instance,

Wed Feb  7 11:14:13 on mterm.rse.com ~ A) xrdb -query |grep -i term
XTerm*Foreground:       greenyellow
XTerm*Background:       dimgrey

but, I start another xterm window thusly:

Wed Feb 7 16:47:31 on mterm.rse.com ~ A) exec xterm -bg "black" -fg \
"green" -fn "-*-courier-medium-r-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" -geometry \
96x24+10+600 -ls -title "A Big Black Screen -- Telnet to mac" &

and:

Wed Feb 7 17:16:53 on t982.rse.com /tmp A) exec xterm -dc -bg "black" \
-fg "green" -fn "-*-courier-medium-r-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" -geometry \
105x49+10+600 -ls -title "A Big Black Screen -- already on a Big, Big \
mac" &

and then:

Wed Feb  7 17:08:48 on t982.rse.com /tmp A) lynx -nocolor -book

The background is black, the unhighlighted text is green, and the
highlighted text is a brighter, bolder green.

The (highlighted) selected text is on a _greenyellow_ (_not_ green)
background, while the text appears to still be green (_not_ black).

If I use my mouse to select (cut) unhighlighted text, then the text
becomes green on greenyellow, same as above. _But_, if I use my mouse to
select (cut) _highlighted_ text, then then the text again becomes
green on greenyellow, but the green foreground text is much bolder..

Now, if from one of these green-on-black xterm windows I:

Wed Feb 7 17:07:40 on t982.rse.com /tmp A) exec xterm -dc -fn \
"-*-courier-medium-r-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" -geometry 105x49+10+600 \
-ls -title "A Big Black Screen -- already on a Big, Big mac" &

the new window defaults to greenyellow-on-dimgrey, and if I:

Wed Feb  7 17:08:48 on t982.rse.com /tmp A) lynx -nocolor -book

then I get a lynx where the reverse videos are readable: i.e. the
greenyellow text on dimgrey background reverses to dimgrey (I think,
it's a little hard to see) text on greenyellow background.

However, if I do:

Wed Feb  7 17:08:03 on t982.rse.com /tmp A) lynx -book

I continue to see only one solid sheet of greenyellow.

Now, if I go back to the command prompt in the (still talking about
the greenyellow-on-dimgrey xterm) xterm window, and use my mouse to
select (cut), I get the expected dimgrey (I think, it's a little hard
to see) text on greenyellow background.

Turning back to the green-on-black xterm window, if I use my mouse to
select (cut), I get the green (I think, it's a little hard
to see) text on greenyellow background -- it's almost impossible to
read: the text is only a little different shade than the background.
It's my belief that the text ought to be black on a green background.

I repeated this test starting from nnwest (NetBSD version 1.4.2),
generating a green-text-on-black xterm window from a
greenyellow-text-on-dimgrey xterm, telneting to t982, (no exec on
t982, still telnet'ed from nnwest) lynxing, etc, etc.  All
highlighting, video reversing happened I presume correctly: i.e. the
green text on a black background reversed to black text on green.

The key difference is that the xterm that worked was 1.4.2, while the
ones that didn't were 1.5.

As to why (NetBSD 1.5.1_ALPHA xterm)

Wed Feb  7 17:08:03 on t982.rse.com /tmp A) lynx -book

gives me a sheet of greenyellow, now that's a puzzle. S'pose to be
bold yellow on blue, you say, Geoff. Well, both the
green-text-on-black xterm window and the greenyellow-text-on-dimgrey
xterm window produce the identically same colour, which certainly
seems to be greenyellow, but I can't find any text in there at all.

no - I think most of the problems were from using the "Foreground"
and "Background" rather than "foreground" and "background".  (It's
not been an faq - this is perhaps the 4th time someone's reported the
problem in the past 3-4 years).

I tested it before I emailed, just to be certain that .Xdefaults is
loaded dynamically (I changed the font to 12x24, which is easy to test).
This is all I've got in my $HOME/.Xdefaults -

Seyon*modems: /dev/modem

*customization: -color

xterm*Font: 6x13
xterm*font: 6x13

I don't have a ~/.Xresources, either.  (I've been using this feature, btw
for more than ten years, so obviously you're misinterpreting my wording).

The xterm program uses screen-display colors according to the color
mappings available from the underlying X Windows system; there can be
odd quirks and sometimes you don't get the colors you want.

From the XEmacs FAQ:   3.2.4: How can I limit color map usage?  

I'm using Netscape (or another color grabber like XEmacs); is there any
way to limit the number of available colors in the color map?

Answer: No, but you can start Netscape before XEmacs, and it will use
the closest available color if the colormap is full. You can also limit
the number of colors Netscape uses, invoking Netscape with one of the flags

    -mono

    -ncols <#> 
or
    -install

(for mono, limiting to <#> colors, or for using a private color map).

If you have the money, another solution would be to use a truecolor or
direct color video.

Ach, of course. You're right.  You meant the app default file -- the
one in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm, on each respective
system, if and when, as you point out, we haven't "set $XAPPLRESDIR to
point to your own app-defaults directory."  We haven't done that, and
we haven't modified any of the XTerm app-defaults files. Everything's
stock. But it slipped my mind.

Except that I have in my .Xdefaults (whoops, no, point of confusion:
it's .Xresources; sorry) file, in each of my home directories:

XTerm*Foreground:       greenyellow
XTerm*Background:       dimgrey

But an application's X resources come from so many places (or go to,
it's been so long (sigh)).

And, I say again, one of those places is from the X server process --
and that's where our <XTerm*Foreground:       greenyellow> was coming
from.

Go to mterm, do this and get that:

Wed Feb  7 11:14:13 on mterm.rse.com ~ A) xrdb -query |grep -i term
XTerm*Foreground:       greenyellow
XTerm*Background:       dimgrey
*XTerm*font:    -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-22-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*XTerm*font5:   -*-*-medium-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*XTerm*font6:   -*-*-medium-r-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*XTerm.geometry:        96x32+10+10

Go to t982, nnwest, do identical, get identical.

Go to t982, do 

 xrdb -remove -

and blow away your X terminal resources (even though I didn't expect
it to work that way -- I believed the documentation).

stay on  t982, do xrdb -query, get nada.
go to  nnwest, do xrdb -query, get the same, exactly nothing.
go to   mterm, do xrdb -query, get the same, blank stares.

go to   t982, lynx and stuff now   works.  No surprise, we did the
xrdb -remove -  there.

go to nnwest, lynx and stuff still works.  No surprise, this is the
1.4.2 machine, and it always worked.

go to  mterm, lynx and stuff now   works.  Surprise, we didn't do
anything on this machine -- but lynx and stuff didn't work just a
little ago.

It occurred to me later that perhaps you meant that I could restore my
X terminal resources from an .Xresources file.  I could -- but that
would have been the initial state of the X terminal resources on X
start, without any of the intervening changes.

(Actually, I was just to darn lazy, and the preceding's just a lame
excuse.)

Hi NG,

I'm using Suse 8.0 and ncurses. I need a terminal with the following
abibilites:

- A_BLINK of ncurses should work
- has 16 colors
- if not 16 colors than at least the possibility to can_change_color.

Thanx in advance

xterm doesn't "do" blinking characters, but does let you set it to a given
color.

Yes I know. But we need to see the BLINK, not a color. So I need a terminal
that *does* the blinking.

BTW: Do you know how to do blinking on a virtual console. I heard I should
disable framebuffer, but I don't know how. Can I set a kernel option? If
yes, which one and where do I set it?

emu (ftp://www.x.org/contrib/applications/emu-1.31.tar.gz)
has blinking text and 16 colors.

For what I could test, it doesn't work great however.

yes - I think I've seen it working properly once or twice.  The last few
times I looked at it, it didn't work well enough to start vttest (some
issue with not sending the carriage return in raw mode).

Maybe, maybe not. It's able to display text in 15 different
colors and blinking. If it's all you need, that it will do.

vim or mutt don't display great in "emu -term emu"

Just try. To compile under Linux:

gzip -dc emu-1.31.tar.gz | tar xf -
cd emu
echo '#define _USE_STDARGS 1' | cat - include/os.h_tmp > include/os.h
xmkmf -a

Note that by default, it comes with three terminal emulations:

emu -term emu
emu -term vt220
emu -term xterm

I think only "emu" term has "blink" and it's not vt100-compatible.

Subject: Bitstream Vera Fonts work with Kermit 95

Bitstream and the Gnome Project have worked to release a set of Open 
Source fonts.  The notion was to provide a free set of fonts which could
be used on Open Source operating systems unlike the "free" fonts which
Microsoft recently pulled from their web site.

These are standard True  Type Fonts (.TTF) which can be installed on
Microsoft Windows as well as  X Windows.

The Bitstream Vera Sans Mono font is not as well populated as other 
Unicode True Type Fonts, however, it is extremely readable.  One of the 
nice things about the license is that the font may be modified and 
redistributed without royalties.  Perhaps someone will add the terminal 
graphics.

You can read the license and download the fonts from

   http://www.gnome.org/fonts/

You will need 'gunzip' and 'tar' in order to expand the distribution.
Perhaps Frank will be willing to place the expanded files on the Kermit 
ftp site.

Thanks, I downloaded and unpacked the .bz2 version on Solaris, then used

A quick inspection of this font shows it's not much more than ASCII plus
Latin-1:  It has the Euro symbol, a couple Greek letters, a few letters
needed for Polish/Czech/Turkish, a few symbols from the Apple Quickdraw set
(per mille, "smart quotes", etc) and that's about it.  It doesn't even have
line/box-drawing characters (what Jeff meant by "terminal graphics").

Although it is an attractive and readable font and installs effortlessly on
Windows, it's not particularly useful for terminal emulation.  Compare
(e.g.) with Courier New or Lucida Console, both of which come with recent
Windows versions and handle most terminal emulation tasks including math,
technical, and forms, plus Greek and Cyrillic, and (Courier New only) Arabic
and Hebrew.

Subject: Need help with xterm programming

I'm porting a code from the SGI to linux (redhat 7.3).  
This is a very old code that used the xterm that launched an
OPENGL program to do input using fortran reads and writes.
The codes is sort of working, but when the fortran code writes into
the xterm, it does not get focus.  On the SGI, the xterm comes to the
front and is on-top of the graphics window.  On linux it remains 
underneath the graphics window.

Here is the code and I'm hoping someone can give me an idea of what it 
is doing.  On the SGI that it works on, the $TERM variable is set to 
iris-ansi.

void putCSI(FILE *f, const char *s) {fprintf(f,"^[[%s",s); }

void textpo_(int left, int right, int bottom, int top)
{
  char buffy[80];
  sprintf(buffy,"204;%d;%d/y",right-left+1, top-bottom+1);
  putCSI(stdout,buffy);
  sprintf(buffy,"205;%d;%d/y",left,bottom);
  putCSI(stdout,buffy);
  fflush(stdout);
}

void tpon_() { putCSI(stdout,"4/y"); fflush(stdout); }

In the fortran code, the user would do this type of call sequence :

call textpo(180,760,300,450)
call tpon()
write(*,*) 'please enter psi,theta, and phi (in degrees)'
read(*,*) psi,theta,phi


Any help anyone can provide with this would be greatly appreciated. I've 
been looking at the limited amount of xterm programming info available 
on the net and haven't found much.  Also whatever the "/y" is supposed 
to be doing is not working, since I found a whole bunch of "y"s written
to the xterm and not interpreted as escape sequences.

TIA,

I suspect on the SGI you're *not* using "xterm" at all, but "xwsh",
which is the terminal emulator that IRIX usually uses.  It has its
own set of private Escape sequences which end with /y.

Look at "ctlseqs.ms", which is part of the xterm sources.  Feeding 
"ctlseqs" to Google gets useful results.  The relevant section begins 
"window manipulation".

Hmm.  That sounds like a bug in xterm, since it should be capable of 
detecting the end of the control sequence, even if it doesn't know what to 
do about it.

Yeah.  I thought it was kind of unlikely that xterm would be that
broken,  but it didn't occur to me that if "xterm" could be "xwsh" it
could also be "gnome-terminal".  I'm sorry to have cast the integrity
of your fine program into question.

Subject: Scroll xterm by page instead of half page?

I'm trying to setup xterm to scroll by pages instead of halfpages when I
hit PageUp and PageDown. Ideally, it would be page_lines - 1, but I can
certainly live with a whole page. I have a strong feeling it has to do
with scroll-back() and scroll-forw(), using a count of 1 and unit of
page instead of the VT-100 default halfpage. However, I've not been able
to work out the exact resource syntax to make it happen. I _was_ able to
totally disable the keyboard once, but that's not what I had in mind,
either <g>.

From the xterm manpage :
        Shift <KeyPress> Prior:scroll-back(1,halfpage) \n\
        Shift <KeyPress> Next:scroll-forw(1,halfpage)

I'm assuming Prior and Next map to PageUp/Down on my keyboard (Linux PC).

My xterms are sized via geometry resources in .Xdefaults, so they pretty
much stay the same size. This means I could kludge.. ahem, I mean
achieve the one line overlap I'd like with a count of lines - 1 and unit
of line (reading further, an obviously better approach would be to use
$LINES - 1). However, I need to work out the syntax to make it happen
first. Can anyone give me an example of how it should go? I tried
following the example in the xterm man page, but I'm apparently missing
something.

Thanks!

"page" is the keyword:

     scroll-back(count [,units])
             This action scrolls the text window backward so that
             text that had previously scrolled off the top of the
             screen is now visible.  The count argument indicates
             the  number  of  units (which may be page, halfpage,
             pixel, or line) by which to scroll.

(but for an overlap - no luck.  Someone sent a related patch which is my
backlog, but it requires some work that I've not gotten around to yet).

Can you give me a pointer on the syntax, or maybe some further
resources? There's an example in the man page, but it appears as if it
involves another layer rather than just a straight assignment :

   *VT100.Translations: #override <Key>F13: keymap(dbx)
   *VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \
          <Key>F14: keymap(None) \n\

          <Key>F18: string("step") string(0x0d) \n\
          <Key>F19: string("continue") string(0x0d) \n\
          <Key>F20: string("print ") insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)

The dbxKeymap translation table is defined in the first line and
assigned to F13. It is then applied (?) to the subsequent keys in the
following lines. Does it have to be assigned to a key first? All I want
to do is simply assign scroll-back and scroll-forw with a unit of page
to PageUp and PageDown.

Clearly, I'm a little confused on how the syntax works! :-)

Thanks.

Perhaps you're referring to /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/XTerm,
which says (among other things)


*VT100.Translations:    #override \
        ...
        <Key>F16: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0, CLIPBOARD) \n\
        <Key>F18: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD) \n\

You can modify that behavior by changing your X resource definitions.
The system resource file itself adds to the built-in translations
which are listed in xterm's manpage.

Well, the n - 1 movement is icing on the cake. :-) Right now, I'd be
happier with move by a full page either way. With each Shift PageUp
(likewise PageDown), the top line first becomes the middle, then the
bottom line, since it's moving by halfpages by default.

I can't be sure offhand if I included the VT100 line - I'll have to give
it a shot.

Thanks again!

no (occasionally someone discusses something of this nature, but
the only implementations I've seen handle only a small subset of
what's involved in doing this).  For example, the readme's for
gnome-terminal claim that it does this, but that is demonstrably
incorrect (except by limiting the scope to the trivial).

otoh, there's "screen" which does a lot of this sort of thing.
But it's not an "X-window terminal emulator".

Not strictly an answer, but this is fixed in Solaris 10 (at last).

Subject: Keeping the X session alive upon broken connection

I am at the end of my wit after four crazy days of searching the net in
desperation.

(No, I am not Miriam Abacha and I don't want to transfer sixteen million
dollars into your account.)

After coming from the MS Windows connectivity world, where Remote
Desktop Connection allows me to remote only one entire desktop, I was
very pleased to see how my Linux machine is able to share either
separate windows or an entire desktop (or several of them!), in flexible
ways.

However, I was less than pleased when my connection broke and I noticed
that that meant instant death for *all* of my apps - the email I was
editing, emacs, everything! So I thought, I'm sure that's a common
problem that has been long solved. I first looked for a flag in the way
I start the server; then I looked for a utility; and before long, I was
desperately searching up and down the Net for a solution.

First, I was surprised that so few people have had this problem. I've
seen a few discussions on the Usenet about that, but not really like
"this is a known problem and here's how it's being fixed".

Second, I have found there are some solutions, none of which is entirely
satisfactory:

1. VNC server. The VNC server does exactly that - it creates a X server
on the remote machine, and then is able to share that for remote users.
When the remote user disconnects, the session stays there. So it's all
nice and dandy, but VNC has two problems compared to X:

a) It can't share individual windows, only full X desktops. Thus one
cannot use VNC-remoted windows managed on the user's machine.

b) It transports bits, not X commands, and as such it is slower
(transports the borders of all windows, the glyphs...) As such, X
transports less over the network because it stores (or caches) fonts
locally and it draws the borders on the user's machine.

2. xmove by Ethan Solomita.

    http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/hpfreeware/X11/Networking/xmove-2.0b2/xmove-2.0b2.README.html

This program is part of the Debian distribution, and it seems to be
awfully close to what I need to do. I even managed to compile it on my
Linux distribution. However, the lack of documentation and examples
makes it impossible for me to get my setup running.


3. XMX by John Bazik.

    http://www.cs.brown.edu/software/xmx/

This is an X multiplexer that can do many thing, among which (I believe)
resumption of sessions after broken connections. I couldn't make that
work to save my life.

4. SCO XVision with the Vision Resume feature, which is supposed to do
exactly what I want. I downloaded a trial version and couldn't get their
Vision Resume feature to work on my Cygin/X server.

===============

So, could anyone help me with that? Any chance of a simple, sensible
program that allows me to keep my X-Windows session alive, but "grayed
out" when I disconnect, so it becomes fresh again when I connect again?


Thanks in advance,

Andrei

Most apps aren't written to hide out when X dies and then come back
when X comes back.  I think XEmacs may be an exception.

I usually run XEmacs from home and then use 'make-frame-on-display'
to put a window on my work machine.  Up until I installed the latest
XEmacs, losing the connection would kill XEmacs.  Now it just
keeps running.

I would guess that if you start XEmacs with the -unmapped flag
and then use gnuclient to create your windows, XEmacs might survive.
You would then be able to get back into XEmacs with gnuclient.

I do just about everything with XEmacs including email,
so this may not be a generic solution, but it covers quite a bit
for me.

That's because it's not broken.  If you don't have a reliable network
or Xserver host, you can't fault X.  You need another layer of
abstraction to isolate the applications from dependency on the network
and/or the Xserver that is serving the physical devices.  That's what
VNC and XMX and others do.

There are a lot of VNC users so you can find help with setting it up
and determining what it can and can't do.  I don't think XMX is nearly
as widely used so you may be more on your own with it.

If you haven't found it already take a look at Ken Lee's site

    http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.framed.html

and search for "groupware" for some other possibilities.

As much as it isn't really a solution, what I do is run everything
through the 'screen' command. (But then, I seldom use graphical
programs, web browser is about it)

I do wish there were a simple solution for this, something that worked
across platforms as I frequently detach my screen session and then
re-attach it from another host.

Something like 'screen' for X11 would really be handy, but only
handy (for me anyway) if it worked cross-platform, some platforms
being really quite ancient.

Subject: How to remove title on xterm when using Exceed

Hi,

I'm on a PC and using Exceed to connect to unix systems (Sun and  AIX). 
Once on the unix system I have an application "foo" that is supposed to
create xterm windows without title bars and borders.  So I have in my
.Xdefaults file the following line:

*foo.clientDecoration: none -border -title

The app creates the xterm windows but the title and border are still on the
xterm windows.

I can cause the problem interactively by entering the following command:

xterm -name foo

With the command above I expect the xterm window to have NO title bar and NO
border but alas I still get the title and borders.  NOTE: It works fine if I
use WebTermX (another X emulator).

Why is my .Xdefaults clientDecoration line being ignored? NOTE: Other lines
in .Xdefaults are working as desired so I know .Xdefaults is being read.

Thanks for taking time to answer my question.

Duane

The answer is really specific to the window manager (in your case, Exceed).
There might be knowledgable users of Exceed in this newsgroup, but it is
not a Unix question.

"doesn't work" for what applications?

There's a bug that I fixed last year for termcap support of applications
such as screen which are confused by the corresponding sgr0 string when
it modifies the alternate character set mode.

See   http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.gz

20040710
        + modify logic in tgetent() which adjusts the termcap "me" string
          to work with ISO-2022 string used in xterm-new (cf: 20010908).

(curses applications are unaffected, but it's noticable in screen).

Then explain how you just crammed 11 bits of information into 8 bits in
hardware....

ANSI colors come from the time where the MDA and CGA were the displays of
choice.  There is no "dim" (except to reverse bold) supported by the hardware.

Only MDAs supported underline, because this was color 001.  Reverse actually
swapped the foreground and background colors at the software level.

In addition to the 6 bits for colors (3 for foreground & 3 for background), CGA
hardware only supported bold and blink.

Now go away.

Quite; that's why you shouldn't be using terminals with programmable
answerback sequences.

And the people who fixed "xterm should be able to report windowtitle"
in some versions of xterm have introduced a security problem because of it.

For a 'bot that jumps on every mention of xterm (or is it just in c.u.s?),
he's got a point.  From dtterm(5) man page:


        Esc [ p1 ; p2 ; p3 t
                Window manipulation.  Valid values  for  p1  (and
                any additional parameters) are:
[...]
                   20    Report  the  dtterm(1)   window's   icon
                         label.   The  terminal  emulator returns
                         ``Esc ] L label Esc Backslash''.

                   21    Report  the  dtterm(1)  window's  title.
                         The  terminal emulator returns ``Esc ] l
                         title Esc Backslash''.

[In 2005]

RFE's against dtterm are unlikely to go anywhere.   CDE is pretty much
in sustaining mode, with minimal enhancements being made, and dtterm is
no exception.   (dtlogin is the biggest exception, since it's still the
default login system for both CDE & GNOME.)

That sounds like it'll just leave gnome-terminal and some flavors of xterm
(including Sun's color xterm ;-).  And of course the non-X Sun console that's
more than once been the subject of some confusion this year.

It would be nice if Casper were able to direct his remarks about the topic
to _constructive_ comment telling how Sun has patched gnome-terminal to avoid
the problem that he's concerned about.  Google doesn't show me any instance
where Sun is reported to have patched gnome-terminal ...

Change and progress is inevitable, I guess, but dropping CDE before
JDS/GNOME's issues are sorted out (W.R.T. meeting the needs of CDE users)
would be a mistake, IMHO.

The Solaris Xserver defaults to only 128 X-clients.
Change /usr/dt/config/Xservers to

... /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -nobanner -clients 1024

and re-login.

Sun recommends to not directly edit the original file;
instead do

   mkdir -p /etc/dt/config
   cp  /usr/dt/config/Xservers /etc/dt/config/Xservers

and change /etc/dt/config/Xservers

Subject: Question about restoring of terminal attributes

Hi,

Consider the following little program which turns off echoing and does
not turn it on again.  (Compiles under Linux).

#include <termios.h>
#include <curses.h>
#include <term.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int main()
{
    struct termios old_termio;
    tcgetattr( 0, &old_termio );  // Assume 0 is a tty.
    struct termios rl_termio = old_termio;
    rl_termio.c_lflag &= ~( ECHO | ECHOE | ECHOK | ECHONL );
    tcsetattr( 0, TCSANOW, &rl_termio );

    sleep( 1 );
    raise( SIGKILL );   // <=== kill self!

    return 0;
}

The fun part is: If the program kills itself, I end up with an xterm
that just works fine while if it does not kill itself I have to reset
it in order to be able to see what I type.

For me, this is a surprise: I would have expected the terminal to end
up messed up in either case!  And the question is: Who restores the
terminal if the signal is raised and what is the rationale?

TIA
   -richy.

/usr/openwin/bin/xterm on Solaris 9 and later is a few years old (not
as ancient as the X11R6.0 version in Solaris 2.6 - 8), but is from the 
li18nux.org fork of xterm, so has a different feature set than the
XFree86 xterm of the same vintage.

The XFree86 xterm is available on the Solaris companion CD for those who
prefer that version, though I'm not sure how up to date it is.

Someday when I've got a good asbestos suit on I'll go talk to our i18n
folks again about switching from the li18nux version to the mainstream
xterm, but I'm not looking forward to that fight.

He's describing the visual bell, so there's no point in turning that on.

However, to answer his question properly, one needs more information.
Sun distributes two rather old versions of xterm (one is a hacked up
copy of X11R6.3 xterm, the other is patch #196 of modern xterm).

For the latter, there's some possible fixes via resource settings:

     bellSuppressTime (class BellSuppressTime)
             Number of milliseconds after a bell command is  sent
             during  which  additional  bells will be suppressed.
             Default is 200.  If set non-zero,  additional  bells
             will  also  be  suppressed  until the server reports
             that processing of the  first  bell  has  been  com-
             pleted; this feature is most useful with the visible
             bell.

     visualBellDelay (class VisualBellDelay)
             Number of milliseconds to delay  when  displaying  a
             visual  bell.   Default  is 100.  If set to zero, no
             visual bell is displayed.  This is useful  for  very
             slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on a laptop.


For the former - presumably Sun supports that, though I've seen no
indication of that in this newsgroup.

While Solaris 10 will probably stay stuck like that, management has
recently asked we dig out of the xterm hole by dumping both of the above
for the next release of Solaris and just shipping the latest official
xterm (i.e. the one X.Org has anointed, and which you maintain on your
site) as the one and only xterm in Solaris, so there is hope in the future.

(Not sure yet when we'll get there, since it's lower on the priority
list than replacing our current Xorg 6.9 with 7.2 and a few other
similar projects, but hopefully later this year we'll see it in Solaris
Express.)

dtterm may not be the worst terminal emulator ever, but it's a strong
contender. I'm currently looking at Solaris, and I was amazed that it
didn't come with a high quality emulator as standard.

When I look at terminal emulators, I'm looking for accurate keyboard
emulation as well as accurate display emulation and it seems to me that
many of the so called emulators just ignore the keyboard side of things.

Of all the emulators that I've looked at on Linux/FreeBSD/etc, only PuTTY,
the Linux text mode virtual console and Thomas Dickey's version of xterm
come anywhere close to been a full and accurate emulator.

Unfortunately, xterm has a lousy user interface, PuTTY is restricted to
connecting to remote systems only, and I'm not about to start developing
software/manage systems using the Linux virtual consoles.

Simon.

PS: My opinions are influenced by the fact that I use the full range of
the capabilities of VT terminals when using an emulator, including
connecting to VMS systems and doing local editing using emacs in
application keypad mode.

( no - they added gnome-terminal a while back ;-)

sort of - I generally use xterm configured with a menubar.
PuTTY has a port to UNIX called "pterm" (ymmv).

"pterm"

I knew that PuTTY has a Unix port (I'm using it on Linux), but I had
completely missed that the Unix port had an additional pterm component. :-(

Looking at the website, I see why: There's no mention of it on the main page
or the download page and the first reference I found is buried in the FAQ.

It works great on Linux, and gives me the majority of what I need, but
attempts to build it on Solaris 10 with the help of a patch found at
OpenSolaris.org either fail (with Makefile.gtk) or build a binary (with
./configure) that outputs a Solaris header and then nothing.

I may have another look when I've more time, but I have seen the compatibility
warnings in the source kit about using alternate pty implementations.

Thanks for supplying the pointer,

Simon.

The Sun Blade 100 or 150 (I've got a 100) has a single 32-bit, 33MHz
PCI bus shared by its graphics and pretty much all the rest of its
other peripherals. For a large window, there may simply not be enough
bandwidth to push that many pixels around as quickly as you might like.

But I suspect it's something else, because I've not found that
objectionable, although I've not used the console of my 100 lately
(having also obtained a used 2000, so the 100 has been relegated to
handling my email and such).

You don't mention what frame buffer (graphics card) you're using - the
built-in PGX64 (aka m64), or one of the possible add-on cards.  But I
doubt that would make a huge differences, given the bandwidth bottleneck
I mentioned previously.

You also don't mention which terminal app you are using.  I've not
noticed such problems with CDE's dtterm, nor even with at least some
versions of xterm.  But I've heard stories of problems with
gnome-terminal.  Xsun doesn't support some of the extensions that GNOME
apps like, and Xorg (which does) doesn't support most of the frame
buffers used on SPARCs.

So some or all of the info you didn't mention may be needed to explain
what's happening. (but not by me, probably - my 100 only runs Solaris 9,
and my 2000 runs SXCE and has a _much_ faster frame buffer).

It is still a part of Solaris/OpenSolaris.

Neither did I, yet, by today's standards, it is a lean model.

Have been using xterm since I don't know when, perhaps 80's.  Certainly in
the 90's.  Always is consistant and there.
