						only one 80-column active session, plus a smaller reference screen with only cut-and-paste capability. Because
						the data is available for immediate use via the controller's multiple logical sessions, users can merge data between
						applications residing on the same host or on different hosts. Any screen size (Mod 2, 3, 4, or 5) can be displayed
						on either side of a dual side-by-side screen. This capability simplifies redundant tasks while providing double
						the information at a single glance. <BR>
						<BR>
						Dual screen capability only takes one cable connection. No complex wiring is required. Unlike alternative solutions

						Product Overview</B><BR>
						The MTX Visara Windows-based Terminal brings all of this and more to the desktop. It offers high-performance and
						functionality through a Media GX processor, multi-session and multi-host access, support for both Microsoft RDP
						and Citrix ICA protocols, and integrated host emulations. The Visara incorporates the Microsoft Windows CE operating
						system and combines the ease of management and inherent security of a terminal environment with the application
						and performance of a desktop PC. It eliminates many PC complexities by returning centralized desktop control to
						the IT manager. Data processing and storage are exclusive to the server or host, therefore creating a true, centrally
						controlled, client-server environment. <BR>
						<BR>
						The Visara enables users to simultaneously connect to multiple host systems. Embedded in the onboard memory, the
						terminal emulation software provides TN5250E, TN3270E and VT220/100 emulation. The Visara∆s integrated software
						offers a direct connection to the host system. It actually bypasses the server and eliminates the need for supplementary
						server-based emulation software. Additionally, the Visara passes full screens directly to the host through TCP/IP
						connections, which increases desktop performance through the reduction of network traffic.<BR>
						<BR>
						The Visara allows users the ability to run Windows 3.X, Windows 95/98/NT applications through a centrally managed
						multi-user Windows NT server. This allows for complete PC functionality. The server establishes the individual
						sessions and all processing occurs on the server. The related presentation screens are sent remotely to the Visara
						and the administrator controls desktop access. <BR>
						<BR>
						The MTX Visara Windows-based Terminal brings high-performance, functionality, and a low total cost of ownership
						to your organization, while maintaining centralized control of your desktops.<BR>

<B>Product Overview</B><BR>
						The MTX 1683 Network Computing Terminal (NCT) is a powerful, cost-effective solution, which provides access to
						legacy mainframe and midrange hosts, as well as the Internet, intranet, and windows-based applications. The 1683
						NCT boasts superior connectivity and a broad feature set, including a resident web browser, resident QNX operating
						system, and resident Citrix ICA support. The NCT is designed to migrate enterprises from fixed function displays
						to intelligent desktops. It not only increases operator efficiency, but also provides for new applications and
						offers a low total cost of ownership. <BR>
						<BR>
						The resident clients on the 1683, including TN3270 and TN5250 client support, enable seamless migration to a 1683
						without disruption to host environments. MTX realizes that tremendous investments have been made in mainframe and
						midrange host applications and that their continued use is essential. The 1683 NCT protects these investments and
						provides direct access to these host applications through a LAN environment. Using the optional coax adapter, the
						1683 operates as a CUT mode device, providing a plug and play replacement for older terminals. <BR>
						<BR>
						The NCT offers an exclusive feature, the Coax-to-Ethernet Bridge. The Coax-to-Ethernet Bridge has been designed
						specifically for the MTX Communication Server platforms, the 1174-S Series. This innovative advantage gives IT
						managers the ability to directly connect into existing coax cabling through a simple plug and play connection via
						an RG62AU (BNC) connector. This feature has many benefits, including no rewiring, no host changes, and no change
						in user operation. This coax connection, coupled with more resident functionality than any other network computing
						device, positions the 1683 NCT as the most cost-effective, highest value upgrade path for mainframe and LAN/WAN
						based organizations. Click here to learn more about the Communication Servers. <BR>
						<BR>
						The MTX 1683 NCT is a true desktop solution. It allows users to migrate beyond a dedicated fixed function terminal
						by integrating support for IP and client/server applications. It offers flexibility in cabling, from traditional
						coax attachments to Ethernet connectivity. The 1683 NCT offers a wide range of productivity tools, which are embedded
						in the resident operating system and will increase operating efficiency. The NCT allows IS managers to add new
						applications at their own pace and offers an inherently low total cost of ownership. It is truly the desktop solution
