Subject: Xterm configuration keys

Hello,

I am trying to configure some function keys in xterm version XFree86
4.2.99.903.

I am using xterm to connect via telnet to an internal aplication which
has it's own function keys defined. I need to map the functions keys
defined by xterm terminal to that aplication. Is that possible? If so
how can I do it?

Tanks in advance,

Paulo

That's usually done with the translations resource.  There are a few
examples here:

Yes, XTerm is a can of worms. There is a file

    $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm

which sort of sorts out the  "num lock" stuff, but all this disappears
if you do your own XTerm.VT100.Translations: from somewhere else (there
is means provided in X11R5 to alleviate this problem, but Sun do not
seems to have taken advantage of it--certainly not in Solaris 2.3).

The following file is one I wrote for the official distribution of the
Jove editor, and attempts to sort out many of these problems. It does
not make the F-keys as shift proof as your example, and it contains
much Jove-specific stuff you may not need. But it may provide some
useful ideas.

Share and enjoy!

! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! This file contains keybindings for xterm to ensure that every key on the
! keyboard (including all function keys, keypad keys, and freestanding arrow
! keys etc.) produces some key sequence that may be recognised by Jove.  The
! file jove.rc.xterm then provides suggested translations from those key
! sequences to Jove commands.  Note: these resources are to be installed
! on the X server and affect its keyboard and mouse.
!
! On Suns, xterm provides a choice of keybindings for the funcion keys, to
! match the usual Sun bindings if XTerm*sunFunctionKeys is true and to match
! VT220-like bindings otherwise.  This file supports both modes.
!
! For keys which are not customarily bound at all in xterm, we have chosen
! bindings in the Sun style, to minimise the possibility of accidentally
! producing sequences that might be meaningful to some program.  Thus it is
! expected that existing applications using xterm will not be affected by
! these bindings.
!
! This file may be incorporated in your .Xdefaults file, or kept as a separate
! file to be invoked by xrdb (probably from within your .xinitrc).  In either
! case, the call of xrdb must be in the form
!       xrdb -merge -DSUN -DSUNKEYS -DJOVE -DXTERM=xjoveterm $HOME/.Xdefaults
! where you should include
! -DSUN on any Sun machine (to cope with the strange Sun bindings of
!                           F11 and F12).
! -DSUNKEYS to define the sunFunctionKeys resource and adjust other
!           bindings so that Sun keyboard sequences are generated
!           instead of the "standard" sequences.  See xterm(1).
! -DJOVE if you want full Jove mouse operations
!        (tells xterm to pass Ctrl-modified mouse events through)
! -DXTERM=xjoveterm if the effects are only required when xterm is called by
!        the name 'xjoveterm' (or whatever), where 'xjoveterm' might be a
!        soft link to xterm.  The combination of this facility with -DJOVE
!        is recommended.
!
! Alternatively, this file may be included in your XFILESEARCHPATH
! or XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, or in the XENVIRONMENT variable, in which case it
! must first be passed through cpp with -DSUN etc. as appropriate.
!
! If SUN is #defined, the CLIPBOARD is used for xterm-style cutting and
! pasting, thus permitting cutting and pasting from cmdtool and textedit
! windows.  This may be overridden by #defining BUFFER (e.g. to CUT_BUFFER0).

Try this in $HOME/.Xdefaults :

aixterm.translations: Ctrl<Btn1Down>: ignore() \n\
Ctrl<Btn2Down>: ignore() \n\
Ctrl<Btn3Down>: ignore() \n\


Make sure the last \ is at the very end of the line, and that there's
a blank line following the last line.  The man page implies that you
can just put "translations:" -- not so.  You need to prefix it with
"aixterm.".

If you need to make it system wide, create
/etc/dt/config/en_US/sys.resources and put the translation in there.
Replace en_US with whatever language you're using.

If you install the chinese fonts, change the language environment
on the CDE login screen and make sure you LANG variable is set,
this will allow an application to do chinese output. If you want
to enter chinese into the application, I believe you need to obtain
a chinese keyboard, then in the smit menu:

SystemEnvironments/ManageLanguageEnv/Change_ShowPrimaryLangEnv

change the cultural convention and keyboard to chinese.

I don't know off-hand if the smit menus are available in
Chinese, but I would imagine so.

Subject: Re: Using SUN workstations with VAXen.

Many thanks to those who were able to tell me how to re-map SUN
keymaps so that I can get a usable [VT100-style numeric function key]
PF keypad when logged in to VAXen.

I am still looking for a way to remove the missing font warning from
the server when things like VUE$MASTER and dxterm.

Regarding keyboard mapping

 In particular,

Kurt Wampler suggested using the xterm VT-100 terminal emulator
program and using the following resource file additions to re-map
the keyboard:

	
	xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \n\
	       <Key>F3: string(0x1b) string("[A") \n\
	       <Key>F4: string(0x1b) string("[B") \n\

	       <Key>KP_Add: string(0x1b) string("Ol")

Jim Pflugrath suggested using xmodmap to re-map the keyboard for the
entire set of X windows using xmodmap.  His input file follows:

  I chose to go the xterm direction with a few additional resources
to change the window geometry and enlarge the fonts so that they're
readable.   My reasoning here was that that would preserve the 
functionality of the SUN keyboard when I was running windows that are
'SUN' generated.

I bet it was a version 1.1A MS-Mouse...
Newer ones (1.2) aren't recognized by Solaris...
I believe they have modified the protocol...

Now I have, at least partially, thanks Michael Piotrowski. On his page
http://www.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/~mxp/xemacs is a description
about how to make X aware of the difference between left and right meta
modifiers, using xmodmap.

For a PS2_DIN keyboard one could call something like

  xmodmap  -e "keycode 66 = Mode_switch"  -e "clear Mod1"\
           -e "add Mod1 = Alt_L"  -e "add Mod2 = Mode_switch"


in .dtprofile or whatever session file is in use. Of course this
doesn't take care which X server is actually used; keymap_ed'iting
/etc/X11/XHPKeymaps should help here.

  xmodmap -pke | grep -e Alt_R -e Meta_R

shows the keycode(s) to remap to Mode_switch.

Start the xserver with the appropriate options.

"man Xsun" with attention to the ar1 (onset time) and ar2 (repeat rate)
options.

If you are using CDE, you can edit /etc/dt/config/Xservers (or
/usr/dt/config/Xservers, if you must) to make the changes permanent.

I am running Triteal CDE on a RH 5.0 Linux box and dtterm IMHO is very
good and just as fast as xterm or color-xterm. It also has features that
xterm doesn't.

some features (the popup with the help panel), true.
but for a fair comparison (X Consortium's not done any significant recent
development on xterm, but we've done that in XFree86), you ought to compare
against things that are current.

The XFree86 3.3.2 xterm supports ANSI color and VT220 emulation

Highlight text in xterm and middle-click in mozilla to paste it

Somebody just showed me that by pressing and releasing Ctrl and then
typing " and a results in a German Umlaut for a. A German sz can be
realized with Ctrl and then ss.

This works for me in most GNOME applications, in normal xterms and in
StarOffice, but unfortunately not in Netscape and pine.

I also have never found this in an FAQ...

Greetings,
        Peter.

Select the whole line, select the shortcut-field, and
press your new shortcut.

This will flip it (not the light itself) on
for the numbers of the keypad. You can hack
the rest out. See 'man xmodmap' (and good luck ;-).

I have no idea what I'm doing, so don't ask.
This was hacked out by me.

If you need to undo it, you'll need to hack out
that sequence yourself, unless someone else here
knows what they're doing.

Vi seems to remap these for while you're in vi.

        In 1995,  Microsoft introduced a new ergonomic keyboard called the
        Microsoft Natural Keyboard.  This keyboard (among other things)
        has three extra keys.  Two of the new keys bear a "Windows" logo.
        The last key has a picture of a cursor over a menu.

        Members of the X consortium and other vendors discussed
        this and concluded that:

                the windows keys should generate XK_Meta
                the menu key should generate XK_Menu

        A new keyboard type/table was added to the Xsun server
        to implement the new keysyms for the new keys.


 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


In CDE "dtterm", the most common form of customisation is the ability
to set the function keys to return set strings. Eg.

  Dtterm*translations: #override \\
  <Key>SunF36:            string("F11 Pressed")\\n


However this doesn't work. The documentation lists the resources and
states that you must use #replace instead of #overide.  The problem is
that you must then know every translation that is used by the program
and its widgets.

Until the documentation has been improved I found that 

Dtterm*dtTermView*DtTerm*translations: #replace \\
<Key>SunF36:            string("F11 Pressed")\\n\\
<Key>SunF37:            string("F12 Pressed")\\n\\ 
... all the other translations as documented in the 
... dtterm(3)

worked for me..

Since I'm an old DEC customer (1980, VMS 1.5) you will understand my
preferences.

I'm using a DEC LK46W keyboard on my Linux box. Connecting to OpenVMS,
Tru64, Irix, Linux. On VMS using TPU/EDT, on others Xemacs with TPU
emulation. Everything works flawlessly. And believe me, Fred Kleinsorge
knows what is talking about.

Which terminal emulator? Are you running an X server (such
as Hummingbird's Xceed) or are you using something like
putty or kermit?

"stty -a" will give you a list of the control characters.
"od -cx" can be used to show the characters being sent by
the terminal emulator.

These are all utilities that concern the Linux console.
They have no influence on the handling of the terminals.

That's normal - it doesn't have the same approach to its
console(s) as Linux has.

That's correct - the terminal (or terminal emulator) puts 
codes on the wire, and the tty driver interprets these
codes. You interact with the tty driver through stty. As I 
said above, the "od" program will capture all the information
coming from the line and display it as either octal or (with
the -cx otions) in hexadecimal and characters. You can also
use the command "script" to capture the whole session in a
file called "typescript".

Nope, the application is character-based, rather than GUI.

Pretty much just a straight telnet session, once we verify that they're
coming from the proper address space.

OK, the output from 'stty-a' on the AIX box is as follows:

Ah - I'd used "script" while I was in school, but I'd forgotten about that

Ok, I probably should have been paying a little more attention to the 
thread, but this finally caught my eye

If I have this right, you used to be using the Procomm thingy on that
windows stuff (ick) but you had some key sequences that used to work.

Now, you are trying to use Linux to access the AIX box?

If that is right - why not just run the native "aixterm" onto the
Linux display and have all the key sequences that the native AIX 
box has?  Just avoid all the intricacies of stumbling upon the 
funky key sequences that every non-native 'emulation' seems to do
a little differently (phase of the moon at build time seems to be
the rule).

Just to make things really clean, make sure the font server is 
running on the AIX box and is included in the font path on the
Linux boxen....

Just a thought....

Sounds like your /etc/inputrc file isn't set up right, or your TERM env.
variable isn't right.  If Home and End keys are generating \e[H and \e[F
, then try modifying your /etc/inputrc to contain:

"\e[H":        beginning-of-line
"\e[F":        end-of-line

That should make the Home and End keys do the right thing when the
active application is bash.  What happens when you enter emacs or vim
and press Home/End?  One thing that might be good to try is to use
Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E for beginning- and end- of line... those should always
work in bash (Your Shell May Vary.)

Since you're using xterm, your TERM environment variable should be set
to "xterm" or possibly "xterm-color".  Make sure this is the case.  It
should be, but you never know.

OK, Thomas guessed it right, the problem is in the app-defaults.

For completeness sake, here's the fix (for RedHat Linux):  from file

    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm

remove the line, under "*VT100.translations", that starts with "<Key>Delete:".

That'll do the trick.

No, because I believe that violates the agreement of the Xorg open

that don't support kbd that they need to work on porting it.

It's been removed now from Sun's builds for Solaris 10, since our
customers don't need to be reminded that we need to port it ourselves.

Subject: Strange behaviour of "Del" key

Hello,

I have a sun6 (GB) keyboard on a Sun Blade running SunOS 5.8.

I want to use the "Del" key (keycode 83) so that I can combine it with
"Alt_L" (keycode 233) in my application. However, the "Del" key behaves
differently from the other keys in that keypad (Insert, Home, Page Up,
End, Page Down) because that is the only key which doesn't combine well
with the Alt key.

If e.g. I press Alt+End, the xev application output shows that the
keycode for End (84) is output, and the state is 0x8, indicating that
mod1 is active (Alt)

However, pressing Alt+Del does not give the expected keycode output (83)
and the state 0x8. Instead, I get 2 FocusOut events, a FocusIn event and
a KeyMapNotify event.

How can I disable this special behaviour of the Del key, and make it
behave like, e.g., the "End" key ?

Thanks

Tor Bye

This is just a guess, but have you checked that your window manager
isn't processing Alt-Del specially?

Actually, the quadruple click was defined in the
Nextstep Human Interface Guidelines;  the reasoning was:

    Single click - set insertion point
    Double click - select word
    Triple click - select line
 Quadruple click - select all text

A somewhat logical progression. Mind you, I'm going off my memory here 
(it's been a while since I've messed about with OpenSTEP).

Keys are keys and buttons are buttons.  I don't think you can simply
mix them (except for some shift state key modifying a pointer button).

I'm not sure whether or not one could write a program that grabs
(takes exclusive control of) a pointer button, and then sends fake key
press/key release events corresponding to the grabbed pointer buttons,
according to the button(s) and key(s) specified in a configuration file.
That's because I haven't done much really low-level X stuff, and I don't
quite understand the semantics of XGrabButton(3X11).  But I suppose if
xbindkeys can grab mouse buttons usefully, it may be possible.

In fact if one wrote a program to send key press events, and ported
xbindkeys, I suppose one could configure xbindkeys to run that program. 
No idea whether such a program already exists, nor how difficult it is
to get xbindkeys to compile on any particular platform that doesn't
already have a binary distributed with it.  Nor do I particularly care
at the moment, although if I had more time than I do just now, I might
try to get xbindkeys to compile on Solaris...

Subject: extra keys on multimedia keyboard - nearly works

Hello.

I have a PC with an up to date version of FC5 running KDE 3.5.5-0.2.fc5
Fedora-Core.

Just replaced a dodgy keyboard with a Genius SlimstarPro
which has twelve extra keys on it. After a lot of googling I have used xev
to track down the scancodes and produced a customised .Xmodmap in my home
directory mapping the extra keys to F13 - F24.

Using the keyboard shortcuts options in the KDE Control Center I have
allocated a couple of the keys to start some programs.

If I run "xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap" everything works fine but for some reason
the changes in .Xmodmap are not getting incorporated automatically which I
believe is what is supposed to happen.

What do I need to do to get this working without human intervention on
each startup?

Thanks,

Graham

Ummm,  FC7 is the more recent version IIRC.  That's like saying I have an
up to date Model T or Vic 20.

You might have better results with keymaps.

$ man showkey
$ man loadkeys

Subject: xmodmap help.

I have an IBM 84-key Space Saver keyboard.  It has numerals and
mathematical operators on the fore edges of some of the querty keys and
"Num Lock" on the fore edge of the back space key.  I assume that this
was so you could toggle number locking by chording the backspace key with
something and use the labeled querty keys as a numeric keypad.  I don't
think that this was done in hardware and there is no option for this
keyboard in any of the confituration programs.

I'd like to make one but can't figure out how to use xmodmap to do so.

What I'd like to do is set it up so that the right alt key chorded with
backspace toggles number locking.  Once I've done that I'd like to have
the "U" key input a 4, the "I" key input a 5, etc when number locking is
on.

How do I do this?

At least on laptop keyboards it is. Do you have a key labeled "FN"?
This, used in conjuction with NumLock does the num/symbol/alpha toggle.

This is a 20 year old desktop keyboard.  The laptop keyboards do it in
the keyboard hardware itself.  I need to do it in software.

The Alt-Backspace->NumLock thing should be relatively easy with
xbindkeys and xmacroplay.  Use xbindkeys -k to find out what modifier
and keycode you get from Alt-Backspace, then have that modifier and
keycode launch a small script that does

    echo -e "KeyStrPress Num_Lock\nKeyStrRelease Num_Lock" | xmacroplay :0

...remapping the UIOP JKL; M,./ keys to KP_? keys when NumLock is on
requires "xmodmap -e 'keycode NN = u U KP_7' ", I think.

Check the output of "xmodmap -pke" for grammar details.
