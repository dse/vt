Hi Richard,

	My name is Bill Hedberg.  I work as a support engineer
for Digital Equipment Corp.  I have seen your postings in the
'comp.terminals' news group.  Just wanted to let you know
that I have posted some termcap/terminfo data to our gateway
machine.  It can be accessed by anonymous ftp at:

	gatekeeper.dec.com   /pub/DEC/termcaps

You are welcome to copy it into your archives.

	Best regards, - Bill
