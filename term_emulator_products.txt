The best DOS VT emulator is ZSTEM 220 by Attachmate (formerly KEA 
Systems). It's not cheap, but I haven't found any DOS-based terminal 
emulator that *tries* so hard as ZSTEM. It can do 132 columns on an VGA 
or Hercules display, and even manages 128 columns on CGA. Useful if you 
want to press some old PCs into service as terminals.

Incidentally, KEA! 420 for Windows is a pretty good (but pricey) product, 
also by Attachmate.

Mac OS X contains the built-in "Terminal" or "Terminal.app" program.

In early 2005, users tested how faithfully this program emulates
certain widely used terminal types.

Actually, if it emulated xterm, it would do the wrapping correctly.
I don't have rxvt at hand, and don't recall whether it did that
correctly (gnome-terminal and konsole don't).

I can see that it passes the vttest screens for vt52 (unlike rxvt),
and implements keyboard repeat (which xterm used to do - but doesn't
since the method for doing that in X affects all clients).  Apparently
it does blink.

Most emulators seem to do a reasonable job there (with the exception of
the 80/132 column tests which are only apparent when the emulator supports
double-size fonts).

It probably implements the ECH feature which I have under the vt220 menu.
Some places it's documented as vt102, and others as vt220.

yes - that's a deficiency of vttest.  Putting the information on the screen
is hard in some cases (so detecting problems does require too much knowledge
about what the test is doing).

yes (nice fonts)

Carnation Software, Inc. specializes in Macintosh communications
software.  The current product line includes MacToPic, MacToPic-Plus 
and SBMac.  These products enable Macintosh computers to be used as
terminals connected to host computers, particularly those running Pick
or similar database systems.

Four popular terminal emulators are included: Viewpoint, Wyse 50, Prism,
and DEC VT101.  In addition, SBMac also uses memory mapped refreshing
for fast screen updates with SB+.  All three programs allow two-way data
transfers, and are also compatible with systems running UNIX and Vmark's
uniVerse.  MacToPic-Plus and SBMac support CommToolBox tools, QuickTime
movies, and other additional features.  Compatible with TCP/IP, Ethernet,
Appletalk, etc., MacToPic-Plus now supports multiple sessions.


PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:   MacToPic

MacToPic, a terminal emulation and data transfer program, allows a
Macintosh to be used as a terminal (connected to a host computer
directly or via modem) emulating ADDS Viewpoint, Wyse 50, VT101 or
Prism.  The emulators support video attributes such as dim, reverse,
underline, 132-column codes, and graphic characters sent from the host
computer, as well as enhanced Viewpoint mode.

Data transferred from the host computer can be used in Mac spreadsheets,
databases, word processors, page layout and other programs.  Other
features include phone list and dialer for Hayes-compatible modems,
on-screen programmable function keys, Mac-to-host as well as host-to-Mac
data transfer capability, 32-bit clean, Apple events support, and more.

The data transfer capabilities are designed to work with relational
databases on hosts running Pick, Unix, Prime, Ultimate, uniVerse, etc.
MacToPic has been extensively tested with the following host computers:
IBM RT, IBM RS6000, Sun, IBM 386/486, Compaq 286/386, Ultimate,
McDonnell Douglas, Altos, ADDS Mentor, C. Itoh, Wyse 386, Everex, GA,
DEC, Prime, Encore, Sanyo/Icon, Sequoia, Fujitsu, HP, ADP, Data General,
and the fault-tolerant Stratus.

MacToPic retails for $195 (US).  Site Licenses are available.

FTG Data Systems has an emulator for Windows that is called "EMU-TEK for
Windows".

Normally it runs $495, but if you are a university student, there is a
limited version for $99. The limited version does all that the full
version does, but it can only hook up over a modem or serial port, not
through a network. If you're interested, please email me or call
1-800-962-3900 and ask for the University Edition of EMU-TEK.

It has a 30-day money-back guarantee if you don't like it for any reason.

The Wollongong PathWay Access for DOS product (which despite its
name provides both MS-DOS and MS-Windows clients) includes a native Windows
TELNET app that supports VT340 emulation.  Other than PING, the PathWay
windows apps are WINSOCK compliant.  I've run them using Wollongong's
own stack (both TSR and native Windows VxD), as well as the WINSOCK
interface provided in Windows/95 and WINNT.

The installer puts the file on the user's disk under the name
PWVT340.EXE rather than TELNET.EXE, which causes all sorts of puzzled
calls from users trying to find the TELNET command.

I've got no opinion on how well it supports unique VT-340 features since
we don't have any application that uses them.

The PicLan emulator, actually emulators, are intended to provide basic
functionality.  They were never intended as replacements for the many effective
emulation products marketed to Pick users.  If the supplied PicLan emulators do
not fill your needs, you can:

  o  Choose one of the many third-party emulators.
  o  Write your own emulator using the PicLan DOS/Windows SDK.

Third-party emulators include products like Via Duct (DOS and Windows), TERMiTE
(DOS and Windows), AccuTerm (DOS and Windows), WinLink, Wintegrate, Termulator,
and many others.  There are even a number of individual Pick dealers that have
in-house emulators that run over PicLan connections.  All of these products are
written with the help of the PicLan DOS/Windows SDK which provides
connection-level services to terminal emulation style programs.  The PicLan
emulators also use this same SDK.

In addition, if you have an in-house emulator, you can add PicLan support to it
very easily.  Simply download the PicLan DOS/Windows SDK.  Most programmers
report that the integration takes less than a day.  The SDK is available from
ftp.picksys.com /pub/modsoft or from our dial-up BBS at (714) 841-2834.

Right, Kermit is able to handle host pools (multiple IP addresses for the
same; if the first one fails, try the next, and so on).  Not just Kermit 95,
but also C-Kermit on VMS and Unix.  This is no accident, since Kermit is
designed for production use in a large university where such things as
host clusters are common, not to mention DNS SRV records (so Kermit can 
find your site's Kerberos server without having it hardwired it into on-disk
configuration files), etc.  We not only write it, we use it :-)

Hi,

I actually use this product--it is free (no licensing needed).

That said, I find it harder to set up and use than either Reflection or Kermit.
I also find that it is not as "configurable" as either of those two products. 
I also recently found an issue that Kermit or Reflection had no issue with, but
one that caused PowerTerm some grief.

We have a two-node cluster, with a round-robin cluster alias externally defined
to our cluster (we are not running BIND on our machines, and are therefore
dependent on our networking group to provide DNS for us).  We were testing the
cluster alias by disabling inbound TELNET on one of the cluster nodes, and then
asking our customers to TELNET to the cluster alias, to see if any connectivity
issues existed.

Our customers use RUMBA; RUMBA failed, in many cases, to find the "surviving"
node, even upond repeated connects/disconnects.  Kermit and Reflection had *no*
issue connecting to the "live" machine; apprently, the software is smart enough
to do a subsequent DNS lookup if the "first" attempt fails.

PowerTerm also "failed" this test, in the same way that RUMBA failed.  Perhaps
the "licensed" version of PowerTerm will work better, but my advice is to spend
the money on Kermit or Reflection (I like Kermit's price better than
Reflection).

Folks,

To be as fair as I can to Ericom...

I repeated the test described to you in an earlier note, regarding lack
of connectivity to a node in a cluster; PowerTerm now seems to be working
as well as Kermit or Reflection.

On reflection (:-)), I didn't--and can't--have enough control over all the
variables in this test (networking, DNS, and physical building locations
are all out of my hands) to make a completely unbiased judgment regarding
the relative merits of these products; I can only offer you my particular
experience, and I should have said so in my previous post.

Of course, YMMV.        :-)

If you are "in the market" for Windows terminal emulators, I'd also
recommend you try CRT/SecureCRT from Vandyke Technologies.

    http://www.vandyke.com/

The product contains excellent emulation and many wonderful features.
CRT and SecureCRT have the same features except that SecureCRT includes
SSH1 and SSH2 support (if you need it).

They have been upgrading the product for a couple years now, and support
have been wonderful.  You can get a 30-day evalution copy at their
website.  I'm a very happy user of their product.  You get one year of
upgrades when you purchase the product.  Less expensive upgrade licenses
are available if you want to upgrade after your year is up.  It's a
reasonable scheme.

UNISYS emulation

A division of Attachmate Corporation makes products emulating Unisys
terminals.

[Unisys, if you didn't hear, was formed from the merger of Burroughs
Corporation and Sperry Univac.  Attachmate is similarly the result
of vendor mergers: KEA Systems and Digital Communications Associates
(DCA) are two of the predecessors.]

Terminal emulators include InterCom. for Unisys T27 emulation
(available for Windows, Macintosh, DOS, and UNIX), and PEP for UTS
20/40/60 emulation (available for Windows, Macintosh, DOS, and UNIX).

For information about product part numbers and suggested retail
prices, telephone the Attachmate Unisys Division at +1 513/745-0500.

From what little I've heard about it, TalkThru (or something like that)

I hate to say it but this WAS a bug. The bug is fixed in version 4.1
of KEA!. For a fix today use the menu editing functions instead of
the global on/off switch. The function to turn off all menus is:

Menus( Reset=True, Position="&File", Hide=True,
   Position="&Edit", Hide=True,
   Position="&Transfer", Hide=True,
   Position="&Options", Hide=True,
   Position="&Connection", Hide=True,
   Position="&Macro", Hide=True,
   Position="&Window", Hide=True,
   Position="&Help", Hide=True )

To turn on the menus use:
Menus( Reset=True )

Use the macro functions in a startup macro or modify your configuration
file in the user directory.

The first run of KEA! normally causes a loss of Windows memory because
KEA! forces Windows to load communication modules. The loss is usually
greatest if any Novell communication method is used.

To contact Attachmate sales at 800-426-6283 or 206-426-6283 or support 
at 800-688-3270.

I hope you find this usefull.

Subject: Re: [Q] Need PC terminal emmulation for VAX

For the last 5 years I have been using a product called ZSTEM VT240 Smart
Terminal Emulator by KEA System Ltd. and I highly recommend this product
to anybody that wants to use a PC as a VT terminal. I have tryed many
products such as ProComm, Smarterm, BitCom, PC102 and many others. 

I will admit that the ZSTEM products are not cheap,around $300 per copy
but they are well worth the investment if you really want to use your PC
as a VT terminal. In my home office I have a choice of either using a DEC
VT340 or my PC running ZSTEM VT240, I use the PC, what more can I say.

I *used* to agree with the above sentiments; I still do when it comes to 
Procomm, Em, and a number of other so-called "terminal emulators". 
Actually, they're more like "communications programs" for the BBS-using crowd. 

I changed my mind when I started using KEAterm (and the previous DOS product 
Zstem).  Tim, since you're at Caltech, you might hear mention of a full-screen 
editor called "mined" (probably only the relics of prior ages have heard of 
it).  It uses all of the VT function keys from F6 to F20, and is usually a 
real problem for a VT emulator. Not so for KEAterm.

When I first bought Zstem, they sent you a "VT-like" keyboard to plug into 
your PC so that keyboard mapping wasn't an issue.  They don't do that any 
more, but the PC I'm using now has a DEC LK-250 plugged into it (more recent 
ones are LK-350's...they aren't as solidly constructed, but do work okay).  
Even without a DEC keyboard, KEAterm can pop up a "keyboard" window, so you
can click on those problematic keys or combinations that your PC can't handle.

And it does color ReGIS graphics better than some VTs (admittedly with old 
firmware) I've dealt with. 

Look into KEAterm.  It's a quality product.   Now if they'd just add Kerberos 
support to the Telnet interface, it'd be *really* great!

Procomm version 2.4.3's VT100 emulation works just fine with our SunOS 4.1
Unix and MicroVax Ultrix systems, GNU Emacs, curses, etc., with one
exception:  their emulation defaults to "Origin Mode=Relative" instead of
"Origin mode=Absolute" like every VT100 I know of.  This can be fixed by
putting

  if ($TERM == VT100)  echo -n '^[[?6l'    (where ^[ means ESCape)

in your .login, or an equivalent statement in your .profile.  Procomm runs at
least up to 9600, and I forget offhand if it goes faster.  Procomm also
supports a variety of up/download protocols.

If you want super-top-notch-whiz-bang-complete VT100 emulation, get a copy of
KERMIT.  It supports practically most features of VT340s and VT102s.
Kermit's user interface will feel more primitive, and it only supports the
kermit file transfer protocol, but it works and it's free.

Frans,
 
I appreciate your reply.  However, we have tested Procomm Plus
a couple of times in the past and found their TV 955 emulation
to be woefully incomplete.  Have you in fact used it?  Has it
been substantially improved?  Does it now include things like
line lock and upper/lower message lines?

P.S.  In doing this research, so far the most complete product
appears to be TTWin from Turbosoft in Australia.  However, the
jury is still out.  By the way, I don't know that Procomm Plus
has hooks to allow a Visual Basic program to look at the data
stream.

NetManage (vendor of the Chameleon TCP/IP package) offers a terminal-emulator
product for MS-Windows called "Swift", positioned as an SNA-to-TCP/IP
migration product, with hooks into the TN3270 module of the Chameleon TCP/IP
product.

(Apparently this product has nothing to do with the financial-industry
communication protocol "SWIFT".)

Anyway, NetManage Swift boasts the ability to emulate numerous terminals:

  - IBM 3270 (models 2-5)
  - IBM 5250 (models 2,5)
  - DEC VT320
  - Televideo 950/955
  - SCO ANSI console
  - Wyse 50/60

and several printers

  - IBM 3287
  - IBM 5256
  - IBM 5224
  - IBM 3812

It also claims support for:

  - SNA
  - TCP/IP
  - DFT coax
  - PROFS
  - OfficeVision/VM
  - Novell Netware SAA Gateway
  - Microsoft SNA Server

Announced price of "Swift" is $400 by itself in quantity one, or $600
in a bundle with the full Chameleon TCP/IP product.  As of August 1995,
the firm had a lower-price introductory competitive-upgrade offer.

If it's a matter of principle, the old MS Kermit for DOS is free and runs.

On the other hand, for $40 you can't beat WinQVT V4.0 for NT and 95.  Its
telnet emulator knows how to map Num Lock as PF1, and its keys are easily
programmable - it shows you a picture of an IBM keyboard and a DEC keyboard and
lets you click both to map.  It's a really nice product.  Your $40 also gets
you a really nice ftp client with both command line and Windows user
interfaces.  And that's not all.  You get a bunch of other Internet clients and
servers.  You can't beat it for $40, and they'll negotiate quantity pricing.

If you need LAT or async connections (WinQVT's terminal emulator is telnet
only), Kermit 95 costs $54, but way less than any of the other commercial
products.  I don't know if Kermit 95 supports multiple network virtual
terminals (WinQVT does).

If a good terminal emulator isn't worth $40 or $54 to you, you may not really
need one.

I didn't respond to this thread earlier because the poster wanted a
terminal emulator that did wyse60 AND ftp.  However, since the
direction it has taken is to list all terminal emulators regardless of
what emulations they support and whether or not they include an FTP
client, I will add that Kermit 95 does support Wyse60 with all of the
Wyse160 extensions as well as Wyse 30, Wyse 50, and their plus
varients.

For security reasons Kermit 95 disables the ability of the host to
read the real contents of the screen.  However, this safety feature
may be turned off by the user if it is so desired.  This feature is
needed for using a Wyse 60 terminal with products like DoubleVision
or multi-session managers.

For details on Kermit 95 see http://www.kermit-project.org/k95.html

as you say the default is as good as it can be, but you can bolt on an

Um, Reflection is the *ONLY* complete VT emulation on the market, AFAIK.
Try to find another that does smooth-scroll when you absolutely
postively *MUST* have it.

Your co-worker DEFINITELY has something misconfigured!

Unfortunately, WRQ has been "assimilated", and both their terminal
programs and FTP client have lost a great deal of functionality in favor
of Windows "integration". Their V6.1 FTP client was really easy to use,
especially if you've ever used LapLink. Their V7.0 FTP client is a total
abomination - the only way to use it effectively is use the command line
within the window - so why bother with a GUI?

Subject: Bare bones ssh for Windows

Windows comes with an application named telnet that does a fair
job of emulating a terminal, but a very poor job of securing a
session. In fact, only a fool would use telnet in today's hostile
networked world.

Instead, most people use secure shell (ssh) to provide encrypted
telnet sessions that keep prying eyes at bay. Unfortunately,
Microsoft does not yet bundle ssh with Windows. They leave it up
to you to find your own ssh app for Windows.

Lots of ssh apps exist, but, from my perspective, they do ugly
things like sparsely install files all over a file system, muck
with the registry, and upgrade Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

I like to keep things simple by using a command line unix / MSDOS
installation methodology that consists of creating a parent
directory then copying files under it.

cygwin ( http://www.cygwin.com/ ) allows you to run traditional,
open source, unix applications under Windows. You need to install
it along with ssh to obtain the necessary files that we use in
our bare bones cygwin ssh.

After you install cygwin with ssh you need to locate the
following files and copy them into a parent directory:

    CYGCRYPTO.DLL
    CYGWIN1.DLL
    CYGZ.DLL
    SCP.EXE
    SFTP.EXE
    SSH.EXE
    SSH-ADD.EXE
    SSH-AGENT.EXE
    SSH-KEYGEN.EXE
    SSH-KEYSCAN.EXE

You only need to copy those files to install ssh (and a couple
of handy, secure file copying programs named scp and sftp) into
any Windows PC. If you want, you can even remove cygwin from the
PC that you originally used to obtain the files.

Those files fit on a pair of 3.5" diskettes. I always keep a pair
handy in the field in case I need to use a Windows PC to download
software from my server.

An example of how to use scp:

   scp -S ./ssh mach@192.168.1.1:data .

In the example, a user named mach wants to copy a file named data
from mach's home directory on a server with an IP address of
192.168.1.1 to the current directory of Windows.

You need to enter the -S argument to explicitly specify the path
to the ssh binary otherwise scp defaults to a path of usr/bin.
Notice that the -S argument uses forward slashes in place of the
reverse slashes typically found in Windows.

PuTTY would be yet easier, as it only consists of one executable
which nicely fits on a single floppy. No need to fool around with
cygwin, either.

You can find PuTTY (which is open source and free to download) at

Okay, as I have an interest in this I'll bite.

CRT 3.4.3
  2.4 Mb Includes a windows installer.

PuTTY
  400k Bare exe only needed. Other tools, agent, keygen, psftp etc are
  around 200k each. Total 1.2Mb.

PuTTY provides full source code, CRT is binaries only.
  Source code is, approx, another 400k.

PuTTY has better emulation.
  CRT doesn't 'eat' all VTxxx sequences that it doesn't support.
  CRT has no support for alternate host character encodings.
  PuTTY can use many different host character encodings including UTF-8
  PuTTY has some support for DBCS character encodings.
  PuTTY has compose key support (on the windows menu key or AltGr)
  PuTTY understands more of the real VT100 codes.
  CRT understands more of the real VT220 codes.
  PuTTY works out of the 'box' as an accurate colour Xterm.
  CRT fails various vttest tests including 'BUG F' and the funny scroll
    regions test, PuTTY does not.

PuTTY has better display
  CRT will only double size it's own font, putty will do any unless
    told not to in which case it will double space.
  CRT can only display VT graphics with it's own font PuTTY can use any
     windows font and even does the 'stepped lines' properly.
  CRT's fullscreen mode either has 'too small' characters or no line
     drawing characters.

CRT has modem and TAPI connectivity PuTTY has only ssh, telnet and rlogin.
CRT can do in channel zmodem file transfers.
CRT has some scripting support PuTTY does not.
CRT has easier selection of emulation, however PuTTY can emulate all the
  terminals CRT can _if_ you set it up.  (In fact PuTTY's Linux terminal
  support actually works, unlike CRT)

CRT's scrollback is limited to 32000 lines, PuTTY's is limited by memory.
CRT has inline printing support.
CRT has a generic keymap editor.

And finally, PuTTY will not let the host overwhelm it.  Eg: cat /dev/zero
will lockup CRT's network module but PuTTY doesn't even notice.

I prefer PuTTY as I don't need the extra features that CRT gives however
before I found and contributed to PuTTY my favorite was CRT (I even _paid_
for a copy!)

Subject: Problem with screen display - PuTTY to AIX


Hello group,

We're having a problem with PuTTY and an AIX box. The AIX box is running
some bespoke software that is usually accessed with a custom Telnet client
provided by the developers of the bespoke software.

Logging in is fine. After some fiddling we've got the function keys/colours
and line drawing working correctly.

On certain screens in the software though, things aren't displaying as they
should.

Things seem to go wrong on the 3rd line down which has a horizontal line
going right across. The first letter of line 4 is right at the end of line
3, line 4 is then out by one character right across. Line 5 (another
horizonal line) looks fine. Line 6 starts one character past where it
should. Lines 7+ start one character earlier on the line before.

Unfortunately the custom Telnet client that's usually used has no
configuration options that we can just copy over to PuTTY, but things do
work 100% correctly on that, so I'm sure this isn't a configuration issue
with the AIX box.

I hope from that awful explanation of what's happening that someone can
help! We've tried every possible combination of settings we can think of in
PuTTY to correct this!

Paul.

That's in the area where PuTTY doesn't match VT100:  line-wrapping.

There's a (more) correct terminal description for "putty" in ncurses, e.g.,

    ftp://invisible-island.net/ncurses/terminfo.src.gz

Thomas,

I take it I was supposed to extract the parts relevent to PuTTY (and
those from the 'use' bits), then run 'tic' on the server to import
the files in?

Well, it took me long enough (and lots of Googling) to work that out,
but it appears to be working!

Function keys too, but I had to replace the function key stuff with
"kf1=\E[M" etc etc.

Does this look as though I've done everything correctly?

Many, many thanks for the pointer!

Paul.

On Windows 98, PuTTY 0.52 uses an all-black mouse pointer that makes it

how to have it a mask or shadow in a different color?

PuTTY itself doesn't do this. PuTTY asks the system for its default
I-beam mouse pointer, and uses whatever it gets.

I've seen the phenomenon you mention myself on NT 4, but I think it's
due to the graphics driver - on other NT 4 boxes the same thing didn't
happen.

The default I-beam mouse pointer is composed of `reverse' pixels, which
are supposed to invert the colour under them, so the pointer should show
up as black when on a white background and white when on a black
background. When I checked carefully on the NT 4 box that had the
problem, the mouse pointer was indeed composed of `reverse' pixels, but
they simply weren't doing their job properly. This is the graphics
driver's fault; the only thing PuTTY does to provoke it is to have a
black background by default.

The only solution I could find (apart from changing my graphics driver)
was to design myself a fixed-colour mouse pointer, with a white I-beam
surrounded by a black outline so it would be visible everywhere.
Installing that in place of the standard I-beam solved my problem,
though it looked a bit ugly on white backgrounds.

Agreed - if you just want a Win* ssh client PuTTY looks like
the better choice.

That said, one of the primary objectives in my original article 
was to explore the minimal installation required for cygwin. My 
research provided the following info:

1. You only need CYGWIN1.DLL to run an app compiled for
   cygwin, unless the app itself relies upon other
   package. (i.e. SSH relies upon the gzip and crypto
   packages, which means you also need CYGCRYPTO.DLL and
   CYGZ.DLL in order to run SSH.EXE.)

2. You DO NOT need to use a cygwin bash shell to invoke
   an app.

3. Although cygwin's bash shell app updates the Win*
   registry, you can invoke cygwin apps directly and
   they leave the registry alone.
 
Granted, those points may seem intuitively obvious to smarter
people. ;)

> You can find PuTTY (which is open source and free to download)
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^

I *demand* open source these days. When I fiddled with PuTTY a 
few years ago, I overlooked its open source.

Here's my reasons for continuing to use cygwin's ssh:

1) Both unix and Win* ssh use the same source. I like to make
   open source apps do double duty in the unix and Win* worlds
   whenever possible. It helps me keep my sanity. :)

2) My perception that ssh enjoys a wider, more diverse user
   base that may allow bugs to surface faster to ensure a
   robust app.

I agree PuTTY is nice, mainly for its simplicity, small size,
character-set support, and lack of any need for an installation process.
But for the record, Kermit does SSH too, as well as Kerberos IV and V and
SSL/TLS (newly supported in VMS, and more secure than SSH), plus lots of
other things that are not within PuTTY's scope.  Plus Kermit has pretty
good tech support.

You can find a comparison here:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/winsshclients.html

(Reflection was not included in this survey because it's not an SSH client.)

In the modern world, file transfer protocols like Kermit are not entirely
passe.  If you already have a terminal connection (SSH, Telnet, SSL/TSL,
Rlogin) from Windows to a VMS host and you want to send a file from your
PC or get one from VMS to your PC, it's quite simple to type:

      kermit -g filename  <-- (to get a file from the PC to VMS)
  or: kermit -s filename  <-- (to send a file from VMS to the PC)

at the DCL prompt; everything else happens automatically, thanks to
advances such as "autodownload", "autoupload", automatic text/binary mode
switching, etc -- no complicated settings or contortions with Ctrl or Alt
keys needed.  Try it sometime (it works the same in VMS C-Kermit when you
use it as your Telnet, Rlogin, or dialout client).

: Since I'm here, I wouldn't mind hearing someone, maybe even FdC,
: provide a tit-for-tat on Kermit versus PuTTY.
:

See chart referenced above.  I actually like PuTTY, but it only does what
it's advertised to do, which is about 10% of what Kermit does, so if you
need any of the other stuff (see chart), and/or you like to have one
command and scripting language common to Windows, VMS, and Unix (not to
mention some other operating systems rapidly fading from memory, such as
AOS/VS and VOS), you might prefer Kermit 95:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95.html

Meanwhile, I should post a separate announcement regarding the addition
of SSL/TLS to VMS C-Kermit, for the benefit of those who missed the

In the TERATERM.INI file located in the same directory as the TeraTerm

Change the line to MaxPort=5, restart TeraTerm and your problems have

Subject: Enabling Terminal.app's FocusFollowsMouse hidden option

I've been a user of iTerm

    http://iterm.sourceforge.net/

as my Mac OS X terminal application for about a year now, and am still
happy with it;  tabbed-terminal windows are great.

However, I recently ran across a  tip that allows us recovering
X-Windows addicts to get a little bit of that old feeling:

    http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031029203936659

You don't get the auto-raise behavior, but focus will now follow your 
mouse from terminal to terminal.  It even gives a terminal window the 
focus when Terminal.app isn't the application in the foreground!  This 
might be enough to bring me back to the OS X Terminal fold.

Enjoy,
Peter

Subject: Help my terminal emulator:  what's the next frontier?

After 2 years of after-hours coding, I have finally released a version
of Qodem (http://qodem.sourceforge.net/) that is good enough for my own
use, so now Icall it beta.  New feature development has cooled now to
shake out bugs and take a breather.  Since you all are the best experts
around on what a terminal should do, I'd like to get your feedback to
help guide its future.What I wanted when I started writing Qodem was the
ability to run console stuff(no X11) with the features I got used to in
the BBS era:  scrollback, capture,"ANSI" color, file transfer protocols,
etc.

At the moment Qodem is essentially complete for my original goals except
for scripting support and Kermit (which will come over the next year or
so).  Now I'd like to make it more generally usable and not just a clone
of a DOS-era program that only die-hard BBS users will enjoy.What I
don't want is for Qodem to be the best terminal emulator around.  I think
Xterm, Kermit 95, and a plethora of commercial packages have that covered,
and it honestly can't be done anyway using only a text-based console (not
enough glyphs, no ReGIS/sixel/Tektronix, mouse, etc).  I don't want to
emulate terminals that are nigh impossible to acquire these days, or
support file transfer protocols for information services that are no
longer in business, or automate BBS stuff that no one uses anymore.

I just want to be a good terminal that anyone could get their work done
withoutthat "one stupid problem" so many emulators seem to have. 
(Examples: minicom's VT102 can't do VT52 sub-mode, which rules out using
it on old Vaxen;

HyperTerminal's VT100 is actually quite good but can't be resized to
greaterthan 80/132x24, making it useless on my embedded PC/104 systems
that redirectthe 80x25 CGA console using the serial port, and it's
scrollback is very flaky;   quite a few good and pretty multi-lingual
emulators can't get basic VT100 right even though they support Big-5
glyphs.)

So I'm asking:

1)  What are the features that you feel are just must-haves in any
    terminal emulator?  Be brutal if you want to.  :)

2)  What are the most aggravating things an emulator can do to make
    it worthless junk in your eyes?  Definitely be brutal on this one.

3)  Outside of Xterm, Kermit95, and pricey (over $300) commercial
    terminals, what are your favorite terminals out there?

4)  Are there any other features you've always wanted but never seen?
