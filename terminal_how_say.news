Umm.  Send ascii over a serial port that's expecting a terminal, and the
it'll think you're a terminal.   If it asks what type of terminal you're
on, type "vt100".

Somehow I don't think this is your question.  But I don't know what that
question is, so it's all I can do.

Explain your situation, what hardware you're using on both ends, what
connection method you're using, and what you're trying to accomplish.  Also
mention what you've tried and how it deviates from what you want it to do.  

With that information, you're almost guaranteed to get good answers from
this group.

There is nothing that you can initiate to indicate to the host
what terminal type you are unless you are working over some other
protocol such as Telnet.

If the host is looking for a particular type of terminal it can send
a terminal type specific query.  If you recognize the query you can
respond to it with the appropriate answer for the terminal type.

What exactly are you attempting to do?

This is a configuration option for the VT100.  A real VT100 can be queried
and will respond with a report saying whether it has the Advanced Video
Option, in which case it can display 24x132.  Otherwise it can display only
14 lines when in 132-column mode.

Therefore the host application can determine the "page size" of the terminal.

An emulator should do what a real VT100 does.

I used to write terminal drivers for a living -- "vt100" was always a
special case.  Very few people actually *have* vt100s, but lots and
lots of terminals claim to be one.

After battling customers for a year, I gave in  and had my "vt100"
driver produce output that didn't actually work on a real vt100

(A real vt100 wont disply 24 lines of output in 132 character wide mode.
This was a very popular display option, though, because it fit more

It will if it's been given an additional kit called, IIRC, XVO, which
added memory and basically turned the device into a VT102.

I'm using a Telnet connection, from a PC to a Tandem machine, the PC being
the client and the Tandem the server. What happens is, the Tandem sends me
some garbage characters (probably requests my type of terminal), and since I
am writing the application, I want to know what to send back to the Tandem
machine to say my application emulates a VT100 or something. The Tandem
server side is already written, I'm using the existing version, which I have
no source code for. Currently, the Tandem sits there waiting for one full
minute before assuming my application is a terminal (don't know which).

Sorry to re-post but....Are you writing this where you work?
Is you employer and Alliance Partner with Tandem?  If so,
you should be able to get tons of help from Tandem.

If you are a Customer, it may help if you call the Global Customer,
Support Center to request help.

If you are a hobbyest,  I guess we'll all do what we can to help.
Tandem does not use VT100 except on their UNIX boxes.
You really need to emulate a 6530 multipage terminal to get 
full functionality out of the Host.

Well, yes -- the "Advanced Video Option".  A lot of people simply assumed
that
it must do something a lot sexier and fancier than just allow a 132x24
screen --
I would sometimes get asked why a VT100 with Advanced Graphics couldn't
display a high-res graphic!

Seriously, though -- it often *isn't* possible to tell what kind of terminal
the user
'really' has, and they often don't know.  Many emulators just Dont Return
What
They Should.

Just to confuse things a bit:  There's "VT100" the product designation,
"VT100" the product *family*, and "VT100" the interface specification.

The VT100 *product designation* properly only applies to the first-
generation VT100 hardware, which indeed could only display 14 lines in
132-column mode without the AVO option.  The same option also added the
full set of four display characteristics:  Underlined, reverse, bold,
blink.  Without AVO, you got one "alternate characteristic", which could
be either reverse video or underlined, depending on whether you selected
a block cursor or an underline cursor.  (The AVO essentially consisted
of nothing but some memory chips, adding extra cells to the display
memory - and extra bits to each memory cell of the display memory.)

The second generation of the VT100 family was cost-reduced, and had no
options:  The VT101 was essentially a VT100 without AVO, and the VT102
was essentially a VT100 *with* AVO.  A VT101 couldn't be upgraded to a
VT102.  (VT101's were quite rare.)  As I recall, the VT10x added some
very minor stuff to the original VT100, but what it was, I couldn't now
tell you.

Within DEC, "VT100" *as an interface specification* was explicitly
defined to refer to the documented interface of the *VT102*.  So, to
DEC, within a fairly short time after the VT102 shipped, "VT100
compatible" implicitly included the old AVO.

(Actually, to be more exact:  There was an internal DEC standard that
defined the VT100 interface.  It consisted of text essentially like that
which appeared in the VT102 documentation shipped to customers.  In
addition, it contained embedded fragments of Pascal code which formally
specified what the terminal should do on receipt of any character.  It
was possible to extract the fragments and knit them together automatic-
ally.  The result could be - and was - compiled to produce a workable,
if inefficient, VT100 terminal emulator.  By definition, this was a
"perfect" VT100 terminal emulator.)

I can.  The VT101, which we bought truckloads of here at Columbia U as
soon as it came out, added local echo.  This let it access our IBM
mainframe through the 3705 (half duplex) front end.  Prior to the VT101,
our VT100s could only access our PDP-11s and DEC-20s.

The VT100 and 101, however, were both quite painful to use with EMACS on
the low-speed dialup connections of the day (300bps, maybe 1200).  The
VT102 added the crucial feature: character insert/delete.  It's hard to
imagine in this day & age of gigabit Ethernets etc what a HUGE difference
that made.

On a related nostalgic note: The VT100's smooth scrolling feature was
quite amazing to everyone when they first saw it, so much so that the
VT100 became quite the status symbol.  As soon as we hooked a few of them
up to the campus "network" (a big serial port switch) and thence to the
DEC-20, the DEC-20 would crash every couple minutes.  Why?  When the
VT100 was in smooth scrolling mode, it would send Xoffs and Xons at such
a hellish rate, it crashed the DEC-20 front end, which was designed based
on the statistics of people typing (i.e. 10cps per port).

At Berkeley the TERMCAP entry for the vt100 with smooth scroll had simply
incredible delays for anything that did scrolling, so it avoided most of
the really bad handshaking behaviour.

I found that smooth scroll made it harder for me to eyegrep documents at 300
and 1200 baud... my point of view would "stick" to the scrolling text
instead of scanning back and forth over the last line looking for keywords.

Okay, well, I'm writing this in my work environment, though not officially.
What I'm trying to do is to write an operator-terminal thingy in
Visual-Basic. Everything works fine, except for the intial 60-second delay
when signing on. I just want to get rid of that. I'm using a winsock
connection to the Tandem, which runs SAFE as soon as you logon (our
SAFEGUARD process). It looks like this if you display it : ^?û^A^?ý^X^?û^C^?ý^_.

which is in ascii:

#255 #251 #1 #255 #253 #24 #255 #251 #3 #255 #253 #31

Know what it's asking? I get the same stuff every time.

One feature that I have not seen mentioned as part of the AVO, which I do
recall as a VT-102 feature not present with real VT-100s, is the printer
port, and the escape-sequence support for printing through it.

You should get those characters as part of the telnet "handshake"
after which you will get a screen similar to:

WELCOME TO SYSNAME [PORT $ZTC0 #23 WINDOW $ZTN0.#PT8MWJD]
TELSERV - T9553D40 - (20FEB98) - (IPMACT)


Available Services:

OSS     TACL     EXIT
Enter Choice> 


This is the part that should take some time.  It really depends on the
load currently on you LAN and the piority given to the TELSERV 
process you are connecting to.
I have logged onto plenty of systems running SafeGuard and never
saw any increased delay after typing TACL  and then logging in.

It also might be wise to include the news-group comp.sys.tandem in the
newsgroups you are posting to.

Earlier in this thread I asked you who was handling the telnet
protocol for your application.  The answer appears to be nobody. If
you are making a connection to a telnet port then you need to use
Telnet Protocol when communicating with the host.  A telnet server
does not use a raw TCP/IP socket.  Instead, it communicates using a
Network Virtual Terminal (NVT).  The NVT processes Telnet negotiations
which determine how the connection is to be used.  The above translates
to

  IAC WILL ECHO (RFC 857)
  IAC DO TERMINAL_TYPE (RFC 1091)
  IAC WILL SUPPRESS_GO_AHEADS (RFC 858)
  IAC DO NEGOTIATE_ABOUT_WINDOW_SIZE (RFC 1073)

Telnet protocol requires a sophisticated state machine to handle the
processing of these negotiations.  Each WILL or DO request requires
an appropriate response and then subnegotiations need to be handled.

Unless you have some very significant reason why you must write this
application yourself I strongly suggest you go out and find a 
scriptable telnet client and write your application in the telnet
clients's scripting language.

The delay is most likely caused by the failure to respond to the
telnet negotiation requests.

Earlier in this thread I asked you who was handling the telnet
protocol for your application.  The answer appears to be nobody. If
you are making a connection to a telnet port then you need to use
Telnet Protocol when communicating with the host.  A telnet server
does not use a raw TCP/IP socket.  Instead, it communicates using a
Network Virtual Terminal (NVT).  The NVT processes Telnet negotiations
which determine how the connection is to be used.  The above translates
to

  IAC WILL ECHO (RFC 857)
  IAC DO TERMINAL_TYPE (RFC 1091)
  IAC WILL SUPPRESS_GO_AHEADS (RFC 858)
  IAC DO NEGOTIATE_ABOUT_WINDOW_SIZE (RFC 1073)

Telnet protocol requires a sophisticated state machine to handle the
processing of these negotiations.  Each WILL or DO request requires
an appropriate response and then subnegotiations need to be handled.

Unless you have some very significant reason why you must write this
application yourself I strongly suggest you go out and find a
scriptable telnet client and write your application in the telnet
clients's scripting language.

Additional comment:

A typical telnet client would respond to the above with:

  IAC DO ECHO
  IAC WILL TERMINAL_TYPE
  IAC DO SUPPRESS_GO_AHEADS
  IAC WILL NEGOTIATE_ABOUT_WINDOW_SIZE
  IAC SB NEGOTIATE_ABOUT_WINDOW_SIZE <height> <width> IAC SE

the host would then ask

  IAC SB TERMINAL_TYPE SEND IAC SE

to which the client would respond with

  IAC SB TERMINAL_TYPE IS <terminal_type> IAC SE

to which the host might respond 

  IAC SB TERMINAL_TYPE SEND IAC SE

if it wants more choices.  (See the RFC for details.)  The host may 
also send more than 30 other options at this point that you would need
to respond to.  The Telnet Protocol (like Kermit protocol) is a 
state machine that implements a negotiation.  There is no specific
set of octets that you can send that will actually perform the negotiation
since the process of negotiating requires understanding the question
that you are providing an answer to.
