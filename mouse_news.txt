First things first:  If you are an MS Mouse user they will give you the 
Intellipoint upgrade.  How do I know?  I called them and now I have it.

Second:  It's not posted because they only want to give it to customers who 
actually bought the product it's packaged with.  Intellipoint is what comes 
with the MS Mouse; I have yet to see it offered as a standalone product.

As far as good, bug free, etc., it is buggy.  It's cute, you get animated 
cursors and some nice control over the mouse.  But if you're using version 9.x 
of the Mouse drivers then you have most of the control already, the only thing 
Intellipoint will give you is some flashy stuff for cursors, sounds, etc.  
Unless you have specific needs, I say proceed with caution.

I don't know about memory requirements under DOS/Win3.x.  I'm on Win95.  That 
brings up another point-- the bugs may be Win95 specific.  Intellipoint 1.1
and Quicken, BTW, bash heads like the dickens under Win95.

Good luck!

It is not the same thing,  but IBM made a terminal that works with a light
pen; the 3192-L10.  It is for use in the mainframe, EBCDIC, 3270 environment.

There are several makers of touchscreen *monitors* in the PC market.  I
guess that you could use this as solution--in conjunction with a PC running
terminal-emulation software.

Good Luck

Usually the data line is bi-directional (it is open collector and the side

Well, I know a bit about PS2, but not the Sun protocol.

The mouse generates the clock when sending data so transmission would be
o.k. but usually the computer would drive the clock inorder to initialise
the mouse and to indicate when not to send.

This as far as I know would just confuse the mouse and be interpreted as
clear to transmit-not clear to transmit-clear to transmit-not clear to
transmit......

That I dont know, but a pic microcontroller is easily capable of talking the
PS2 protocol but as I say I dont know about the Sun one.

To quibble a little:

The older SGI mouse were pure serial mice working at RS423 levels.
The specs for them are given in the mouse(7) man page. They could in
theory be plugged in to any RS423 compatible serial port and used
with an appropriate driver. Probably the logic for any "serial mouse"
could be relatively easily adapted for this purpose.

That is, there wasn't anything about those mice that constrained them
for use on SGI systems.


The PC keyboard and PC mouse used on the newer SGI systems uses a
different serial protocol that shares a single Data line between the
host and the device. The end that is holding the Clock pin low is the
end that is transmitting. The Clock pin doesn't seem to have any
timing-related functions. The interface is not RS232 or RS423 compatible,
so you end up pretty much locked into buying (or building) a chip
specifically to handle these devices, instead of being able to use
any handy serial port like you could with the older mice and keyboards.
And that also means that for the newer keyboard and mouse you cannot
use the well-understood termios ioctl()/tc[sg]etattr() coding: you
have to learn a different device control interface just for this purpose.


You can probably deduce which of the two generations I believe to be the
better design ;-)

Thanks to all respondents.
This last posting was the winning entry !

To summarize (and this is strictly my experience).

The standard PS/2 mouse driver does NOT work.

Here is how I got things to work with a Logitech driver:

1 - go to http://www.logitech.com/us/support/mousefiles.html and
   download the M83SETUP.EXE package.

2 - run it, it installs a bunch of drivers for Logtech mice.
  after reboot, make sure you have "PS/2" as your mouse driver in
   the Mouse Control Panel

3 - unfortunately, they don't give you the configuration software for free.
  the default configuration is to make the middle button behave like
  a double-left click.  this is NOT what i wanted.  to enable the middle
  button,

  - run "regedit"
  - go to

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Logitech\MouseWare\CurrentVersion\Setup\PS2\0000
  - change the entries
        "NumberOfButton"        to "3"
        "DoubleClick"           to "0000"

4 - reboot

I should say this is on Windows 95.  In NT, things work up to step 2,
but there are no reg entries (that i could find) that allow you to
get rid of the double-click behavior.

Subject: getting your serial mouse to work on all 3 buttons

If you have a cheapy 3 button serial mouse with an inoperative middle
button under X, there is a cheap and easy way to make it work properly, so
long as you aren't afraid of a soldering iron. To be sure it's not likely
to have any undesirable effects, run xev and prove that the middle key is
completely ignored like mine was.

All you have to do is grab 2* .5 amp diodes (little ones, anyway) and
connect the output of the middle microswitch to the outputs of both left
and right buttons so that pressing the middle button will do the
equivalent of pressing both buttons simultaneously (naturally you have to
have the option 'emulate 3 buttons' turned on). All three switches will
have one pin in common, which is + supply, one non-common output pin and
one dangler.

It's a bit hard to draw a diagram, but just make sure you have the anodes
of the diodes attached to the non-common pin on the middle switch and the
cathodes one to each non-common pin of the other two switches. Make sure
you don't accidentally short any tracks with the diode leads. You could
set the emulation timeout super low now to prevent accidentally clicking 1
& 3 like you used to and run xev if it doesn't seem to be working - you
should get a 'button 2' report when pressing it just like when you were
pressing 1&3 together.

so now you can use that $5 mouse instead of coughing up for the $30-50
logitech.... (I've still got one of those on my best machine, though, they
really are great!)

NB: no responsibility accepted for damaged hardware when you screw it up
or if it doesn't work in your situation... ;)

Hi There,

I had problems with that also.  I suspect that xf86config does not figure
out the MS-Intellimouse information correctly.  I had to look at my old
pre-xf86configed XF86Config file.

Look at /etc/X11/xf86config file.  About half way into that file, you will

Read the man page for XF86Config to get the proper protocol.

My wheel mouse works just about perfectly in KDE-2.1.1 and Mozilla.  I have 
also built the utility imwheel to use the scroll wheel in other apps, 
notably Netscape.

I have not seen the option in kdmconfig for a wheel mouse of any brand.  
There may be some way to use that scroll wheel in XSun, but I doubt it.  If 
you do find a way, let me know too.  The only reason I installed XFree86 
was to get the ability to use the scroll wheel.

If you're using a Sun type-5 mechanical or optomechanical mouse, it's possible
to upgrade it fairly easily from 1200bps to 4800bps.  This dramatically
decreases movement latency and works "out of the box" with Solaris 2.3 and
above:

Subject: Re: Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer Wheel in KDE/X


Check the FAQ - 11.4. My mouse has a fancy wheel. Can I use it in X? 

    http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/x.html#X-AND-WHEEL

..works very well for me. Hard to describe the helpless feeling when using a 
mouse without a wheel :)

Subject: Re: Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer Wheel in KDE/X

I've arranged my XF86Config (as per example 11-5 in the above document) as 
follows:

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Mouse0"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "Protocol" "MouseSystems"
        Option          "Device" "/dev/sysmouse"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
EndSection

I've installed imwheel with no change in ..../imwheelrc and when I run KDE 
moving the wheel doesn't produce any action.
Any suggestion?

PS - With this BSD del cazzo I never got any examples running with me.

You need to tell the X server that you have 5 buttons first... use this
fragment:

        Option          "Buttons" "5"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"

What kind of mouse are you using?

Awhile back I bought a Macally "Ice Mouse Jr." and tried to use the
Mac OS X (10.2.6) system preferences to set the mouse speed, and it
still seemed slow.  However when I downloaded and  installed the
specific Macally drivers and used the Macally software  interface
to the set the mouse speed, it sped up quite significantly. 

Not sure what brand of mouse you are using but you might want to try 
using the specific software that comes with the mouse. Also, check
the vendor's website because a vendor generally offers newer drivers
than what gets shipped with the actual mouse on a CD.

Hope this helps.

I'm using a Kensington PocketMouse Pro wireless on an Apple G4 Powerbook
and I am delighted with its operation ...

The USB receiver is adjustable for better reception (through 270 degrees)
and range is easily 20 to 30 feet (i.e., I can use it for clicking through
presentations as well).

Not a complaint, but the only slight issue I have observed is that it has
a battery-saving 'sleep' which kicks in after a few minutes inactivity;
this obviously is worthwile but you get a fraction of a second or so of
wakeup delay when you reactivate.

The remainder of the operation is flawless, including optical tracking 
and 3-button operation with accurate scrolling.

I previously used a wired version on a Windows laptop and was impressed,
but this is considerably better again ...

I grabbed this from the faq's on kensington.com.  They say the 
batteries should last three months!

1) Mouse - The mouse communicates to the receiver at a frequency of 27 MHz.
   It operates on standard 1.5V AAA battery cells. Batteries should last
   3 months under average conditions.

2) Receiver - Twist the receiver up to 270 degrees (3/4 of a complete 
   turn) to make sure that it is receiving the clearest signal possible. 
   Note: Do not try to twist the receiver past the maximum point.

I think you're out of luck.  The keyboard/mouse you describe uses an HP-HIL

Comment: An answer to Bill Coderre....
Subject: Mice for the Ambidextrous

If Bill Coderre wants something for his left hand to do while his right hand is 
busy with the mouse (a most understandable wish), he might be interested in 
taking a look at AUGMENT, the Tymshare product which evolved from Doug 
Engelbart's NLS, which was developed at SRI.  That's where the mouse itself was 
invented.  Its developers recognized the need for a control device usable by the
hand not busy with the mouse, and developed a five-key "keyset."  Looks sort of 
like a little piano keyboard, sitting (usually) to the left of the keyboard, 
with the mouse on the right.

We've been using the keyset, together with a three-button mouse, since the late 
60's (Doug Engelbart -- Engelbart@Office-2.ARPA) could give you a more precise 
date -- works beautifully, and does just exactly what Bill is asking for.  As a 
matter of fact, I'm using one now -- mouse and keyset hooked to a PC/XT -- to 
send this message.

It's nice to see people thinking along these lines.  They used to laugh when I 
sat down at the mouse & keyset.... "What's THAT?" they said....

I don't remember ball-type mice until the 1980s, but I definitely remember
mice with two rubber wheels at 90 degrees in the late 1970s.

I forget if Altos had the ball mice or the wheels.  I think that they had
the wheels, and the switchover was with the Dolphin.

Pucks and digitizing pads? I don't know when they came out, but they
were *expensive*, even by the standards of the day. Light pens could
be implemented in software, and what must have been about the first
home video game (Magnavox Oddysey) had a light pen/light gun.

Pantograph-style digitizing tablets are pretty old (1965), but they had
an arm directly connected to the cursor, or a mechanical "follower" arm
tracking it mechanically under the table. The modern digitizer that
uses a grid of EM sensors and a coil is definitely much later than the
light pen.

Yes, yes, and the next optimization is to find the smallest rectangle that
changed in the previous calculation, and then you subdivide into multiple
active zones...

The point is that on the vt100 you don't have to be very fast for your
update rate to be limited by the serial connection, if your generation
calculations are as well optimised as your update calculations.

Make that four seconds, the VT100 can only display at 480 cps maximum.
Fast enough for glass tty mode, a pain if you use VT100.TEC.   :-(

I don't understand that, but at the time when VT100s were in everyday
use, I didn't have an OS with a "termcap".  IIRC, ESC[2J should
complete in less than 8 ms, and there's about 45 ms after the Xoff  at
9600 before the buffer overflows.

That assumes the buffer was empty, no?

50 ms may be overly conservative, but most of those figures were derived
from practical experience.

Was there ever a VT100.TEC? I can recall VT52.TEC and VTEDIT.TEC. It
was wonderful on VT100's. Teco has a beautiful screen draw algorithm
that works out the shortest string involving scroll up down and direct
cursor addressing only when appropriate - all written round the VT100's
tricks. I still see it working its magic when ssh-ing from my Mac
laptop to a VMS box over mobile phone. (I'll admit that split screen
teco (3,7:w) mode is faster than VTEDIT in those circumstances, but it
uses the same screen redraw)
VTEDIT was far better than any other screen based editor on VT100 as
far as using a slow line went. I nicked the ideas in that code for many
a job.
On the other hand, all the other users on our VAX750 would come round
to lynch me if I dared use VTEDIT during daytime. Did it guzzle cpu!

I regularly use Logitech USB mice on SunBlades.  (No wheel support yet

there is a mouse / tablet combination availble from wacom (NOT usb)
which will work with sun workstations. much, much better than a mouse
when you get the hang of them.

I'd also recommend you get the USB version for your PC at home.

The scroll wheel on most USB mice should work if you're running Sun Ray
Server Software 2.0, but only in certain applications.  The gtk+ toolkit
Mozilla/Netscape 7 and StarOffice.

Subject: announce: USB wheel mouse support in Solaris

I am happy to announce free drivers (source, + x86 binary package)
available to support a USB wheel mouse, with Solaris and Xsun.

Previously, you could use the "wheel" as the standard middle button,
but there was no support for actual rotation. Now you can get support for
it, using the drivers at:

    http://www.bolthole.com/solaris/drivers/usb-usbsm.html

There are probably bugs (and in fact, there is one definate, but
only partially understood bug) , but generally speaking, "it works for me".
So this is the official first release. 

Thanks go to   Chris Morgan and  Richard L. Hamilton for
"sponsoring" this driver. I have the feeling they did it as much
for finally having a reply to the "how do I get my wheel mouse
working in solaris" posts, as for their own direct benefit ;-)

Many thanks; I wouldn't have noticed until it got into patchdiag.xref.

To all those that worked on it: a _big_ woohoo!  It works! IT WORKS!

(My mouse is a Logitech TrackMan Wheel, P/N 504360-0000; arguably not
the easiest, so if it works with that, it should hopefully work with
most USB wheel mice.)

For those not already aware, it only works with toolkits that know about
the mousewheel to button 4 and button 5 mapping that's become conventional,
like gnome (so mozilla works, at least if you enable it in the
preferences), and KDE.  So it works in OpenOffice, too.

If one looks at places like

    http://koala.ilog.fr/colas/mouse-wheel-scroll/

and even more (but you have to separate mouse-wheel related resources
from other stuff that you really may not want; only take the resources
whose values contain one or more of Btn4Down, Btn4Up, Btn5Down, Btn5Up;
but they do have some others that some may find interesting too, even if
they might need to be modified) at

    http://www.bwalle.de/config/Xresources

there are resources one can add to one's .Xdefaults to make it work for
Motif apps (and Athena widgets apps), too.  With _most_ Motif apps it will
only work if the pointer is over the scroll bar, although with the Nedit,
if the resources specific to that are set, it will work with the pointer
over the text area too.  If someone finds away around the limitation
on the Motif apps, please pass the word!

Now, a question: if (with all these patches) one accesses a wheel mouse
as an X extension device, are the wheel steps still mapped to buttons
4 and 5 (as they have to be for a core X device, which is limited to
5 buttons and two axes), or is the wheel treated as an additional axis?
I ask because the <sys/vuid_wheel.h> include file seems to imply the
possibility (at the driver level if not necessarily at the X server level)
of dealing with multiple wheels (typically horizonal and vertical, but
potentially more).  If the wheels have additional meaning for an X
extension device, that reinforces my last point for this post:

Next on my personal X server related agenda: when will X extension devices
(like a buttonbox) work with XKB enabled?  Last I tried (not this patch,
but not that long ago), if XKB was enabled and one accessed an X extension
device, the X server would crash.

It was being held until the kernel patches got released, and then for

yesterday so it should be appearing on the various SunSolve servers
around the world today and tomorrow.  (Actually -38, which was ready to
go, instead of just -36.)

You're welcome.  (Though I can only take credit for the part in Xsun -
much of the work was done by the USB team in the USB & PS/2 drivers.
I'll forward your note on to them as well.)

|(my mouse is a Logitech TrackMan Wheel, P/N 504360-0000; arguably not

|most USB wheel mice)


We've got a long list of mice that it worked on in the internal testing,
but no entries yet under the "doesn't work" column (though perhaps
that's just underreporting, but still a good sign that most common mice
follow the common de-facto standards here).


|For those not already aware, it only works with toolkits that know about

|like gnome (so mozilla works, at least if you enable it in the

The S9 patch includes the Solaris xterm app-defaults changes for scrolling.

In Solaris Express/10, several CDE applications & widgets also got
scrolling support, but those were not backported to S9 - you can easily
get the same effects via $HOME/.Xdefaults entries such as this though
(or can customize it for the scroll speed you want):

*DtTerm*Translations: #override \
        Shift<Btn4Down>:        scroll(-1,page) \n\
        Shift<Btn5Down>:        scroll(1,page) \n\
        None<Btn4Down>:         scroll(-5,line) \n\
        None<Btn5Down>:         scroll(5,line)

*DtEditor.textTranslations: #override \
        Shift<Btn4Down>:        previous-page() \n\
        Shift<Btn5Down>:        next-page() \n\
        None<Btn4Down>:
process-up()process-up()process-up()process-up()process-up() \n\
        None<Btn5Down>:

        <Btn4Down>:            PageUpOrDown(1)\n\
        <Btn5Down>:            PageUpOrDown(0)


|Now, a question: if (with all these patches) one accesses a wheel mouse
|as an X extension device, are the wheel steps still mapped to buttons
|4 and 5 (as they have to be for a core X device, which is limited to
|5 buttons and two axes), or is the wheel treated as an additional axis?


For now, it's not treated as an additional axis in any mode, core or
extension device.  You can change what the wheel events are mapped to
via OWconfig - unfortunately, like the rest of OWconfig it's undocumented
and support may not want to talk you if you try to edit it, but if you
don't mind that, here's the scoop (as written a while ago by an engineer,
not a tech writer, so apologies in advance for the non-user-friendliness):

    You can configure what X events are sent when you "roll" the wheel
    on WheelMice in a number of ways by editing the class="XINPUT"
    entries in the OWconfig file.

    For example, to make the mouse on a SPARC system roll in the
    opposite direction of the usual, you would change the "IMOUSE" entry
    in /usr/openwin/server/etc/OWconfig to look like this:

        # Sun Mouse module
        class="XINPUT" name="IMOUSE"
            wheelmaps="1=buttons 5 4"
            ddxHandler="ddxSUNWmouse.so.1"
            ddxInitFunc="ddxSUNWmouseProc";

    On x86, the mouse XINPUT entry is usually found in
    /etc/openwin/server/etc/OWconfig and would be changed in a similar
    fashion.

    The format of the wheelmaps option is:

        wheelmaps="wheelid=[times x ]action[,wheelid2=[times2 x ]action2...]"

    wheelid is an integer in the range 1-255 to specify a specific wheel
    or a * to match all wheels without a specific entry.

    An action of "axis X" or "axis Y" maps wheel rolls to movement along
    the specified axis. An action of "buttons A B " maps negative deltas
    to presses & releases of button A, and positive deltas to presses &
    releases of button B. An action of "keycodes A B " maps negative
    deltas to presses & releases of a key with keycode A, and positive
    deltas to presses & releases of a key with keycode B. (Mapping these
    keycodes to keysyms is left to the user, sysadmin, and/or desktop
    defaults.) An action of "discard" discards the events.

    The optional times modifier specifies number of times a button or
    keyboard event should be generated for each delta unit of wheel
    motion, or the number of pixels the delta should be multiplied by
    when generating motion events. The value must be a positive number
    for button and keyboard events, but may be negative for motion
    events. (Normally rolling the wheel "up" generates motion towards
    the origin, so specifying a negative pixels value reverses the
    direction of the motion.) If the times modifier is not specifed, the
    default value of 1.0 is used for all types of event. If a
    non-integer value is specified, events may be buffered until enough
    are accumulated to represent a whole event. For example, if a value
    of 0.25 is specified, only one out of every 4 single-delta wheel
    events will be reported.

    If not specified, the default for a mouse device is equivalent to:

       wheelmaps="*=1.0 x buttons 4 5"

    for compatibility with the XFree86 defaults, Sun Ray implementation,
    and existing wheel mouse aware X applications. When one or more
    wheels on a mouse device are mapped to buttons, the mouse DDX will,
    if necessary, increase the number of buttons the mouse is reported
    as having to at least as many as the highest button id assigned to a
    wheel action.

    For example, when testing with the Logitech MouseMan Wheel, I found
    it worked better with a slightly modified configuration. This mouse
    has 3 buttons plus a wheel, which can also be pressed as a button.
    In the default configuration, pressing the wheel button is reported
    as button 2, while the button on the side where the thumb normally
    rests is button 4. The default configuration resulted in the thumb
    button presses scrolling up, just as rolling the scroll wheel up
    did. To make the buttons more usable it was simply necessary to set
    the wheelmap action to "buttons 5 6" and then use "xmodmap pointer =
    1 6 3 2 4 5" which mapped the "thumb" button to button id 2, the
    wheel as a button to button 6, and the turns of the wheel to buttons
    4 & 5 where the clients expect them.

    (Note that this all only applies to the DDX modules for directly
     connected devices, not Sun Rays.)

[Yes, that was a huge cut and paste.  The original was even longer and
more overwhelming to non-engineering types with a full BNF description
of the syntax.  It was also a little easier to read in HTML format so
the parameters showed up in italic.  Perhaps I'll post it to my blog on
blogs.sun.com one of these days.]

I didn't know that was a problem - I'll see if I can reproduce it one of
these days and if so, add it to the long list of XKB bugs I've got to work
on.   (I'd tell you what's next on my X server agenda, but I don't think
I can talk about it until certain announcements/releases are made later
this month.  It's definitely much more work than wheel mouse support.)

Putting the following into /etc/dt/app-defaults/C/Dtterm
even allows to kind of scroll inside of "less" (like, if
env var PAGER is set to 'less -s', also in "man")... ;-)

I'm not sure if the patch contains the same default translations
for xterm and other old tools, but you can add something like:

XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \
                None<Btn4Down>:         scroll-back(1, halfpage) \n\
                None<Btn5Down>:         scroll-forw(1, halfpage)

to your .Xdefaults file to get a mouse wheel working in xterm.

Other applications have it hidden somewhere deep in menu structures and
you need to enable it explicitely (exmh, for one)

Assuming a USB mouse or trackball, I don't know about "supported", but
trackballs typically behave just like mice as far as the system is
concerned, so they should work; I use a Logitech TrackMan Wheel (USB) (the
wheel only works with a recent set of patches, and that's on Solaris 9, I
haven't checked if they're available for Solaris 8).  Assuming an older
system with a Type 5 serial mouse and keyboard, they're strange and _not_
compatible with anything for a PC, however an adaptor is available (and in
my experience makes all devices look like they only have 2 buttons, even
if they have 3).

Try using the program xev (/usr/openwin/demo/xev) to find out which button
numbers the buttons have; and if they're not the ones you want, you
should be able to remap them with xmodmap.

Most Unix toolkits assume a 3 button mouse, but make some provision for
working with a 2 button mouse.  Button mapping (unless modified by xmodmap
or some GUI option that does the same sort of thing) is normally 1=left,
2=middle, 3=right.  Usually, 2 button mice or trackballs are made to look
like they leave out the middle button; perhaps this one for some crazy
reason looks like it's leaving out the right button?  (xmodmap could remap
that easily enough; but if you use xmodmap, you'll probably have to put
the command in some per-user startup file so it gets run every time they
log in)

http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/806-6873/6jfpm4g34?a=view

says that GNOME 2.0 on Solaris uses the buttons as follows:

If it works, that would set the LED, which according to what you describe
would be enough to cause the X server to assume the corresponding shift
state at startup.

But (if only for completeness), it looks like there's no way (short of
digging in /dev/kmem in a most outrageous manner) to programmatically
manipulate the shift state while in plain old console mode.  It might
be nice if there were an additional kb(7m) ioctl to do that; I'd think
it would be easy enough to implement...

I haven't tried, but you should be able to just create the SPARC
equivalent of the configuration file that kdmconfig would create for you.

Try editing /usr/openwin/server/etc/OWconfig and in this section:

# Sun Mouse module
class="XINPUT" name="IMOUSE"
        ddxHandler="ddxSUNWmouse.so.1"
        ddxInitFunc="ddxSUNWmouseProc";

Change it to look like this (add the emulTimeout line--set the timeout
to whatever speed you prefer; kdmconfig offers 25, 50, and 100 as the
usual options):

# Sun Mouse module with 100 ms 3-button emulation
class="XINPUT" name="IMOUSE"
        emulTimeout="100"
        ddxHandler="ddxSUNWmouse.so.1"
        ddxInitFunc="ddxSUNWmouseProc";

But this link only exists if the DCA has detected a PS/2 mouse device.

If you use a serial mouse, or an usb mouse, /dev/kdmouse doesn't exist.

Maybe your system's BIOS does not detect a connected PS/2 mouse device
at boot time when the kvm has connected keyboard/mouse to another
system at boot time.  So the PnP device database / ACPI information
does not list a PS/2 mouse device when Solaris boots, so that Solaris
won't create the /devices/isa/i8042@1,60/mouse@1 device?

|
|I'm using Solaris 10 x86 and the Sun xserver (not xorg).

Right now, this is much much easier to set up with Xorg than Xsun.
Xorg can be configured to just use multiple mice at once, while Xsun
recognizes only one mouse at a time as controlling the cursor.

You can configure Xsun to use multiple mice, but will still have to run
a program to switch which mouse is active (you won't have to exit your
session and restart though).

For Xsun with a USB & a PS/2 mouse:

1. pkgrm SUNWxwmod and reboot

2. For each mouse device (leave the one you want to be default
   until last to make things easier), run kdmconfig and configure the mouse
   device. After each one is successfully configured, go into
   /etc/openwin/server/etc/OWconfig and save the class="XINPUT" section
   for the mouse device.

3. Once you've got all the correct sections and have kdmconfig set
   to the device you want to be default, vi the OWconfig file and paste in
   the sections for all the other devices. Make sure each XINPUT class
   entry has a unique "name" field. There should be a section
   class="XDISPLAY" name="0" with corePointer= the device name you chose to
   be default.

4. vi /usr/openwin/server/etc/OWconfig and comment out the lines
   for class="XINPUT" and name="NKBD" & name="NMOUSE". (Otherwise it will
   be difficult to tell which devices are real devices and which are the
   virtual "null" devices.)

5. Download and build xinput from
        http://www.x.org/contrib/utilities/xinput-1.2.tar.gz
   (README at http://www.x.org/contrib/utilities/xinput.README )

6. Restart Xsun and login. You should be able to move the mouse
   with the default device, use "xinput list" to list all the devices, and
   "xinput set-pointer <device-name> to switch the mouse pointer to be 
   controlled by a different device. (Unfortunately, it's hard to tell
   which device is which from the xinputdev list, but if you only have 
   two it should be easy to tell which is currently "core" (controlling
   the mouse cursor) and which is "extension" (not controlling the mouse
   cursor).

For Xorg with a USB & PS/2 mouse:

1) Create an xorg.conf using either xorgconfig or by running 
   "Xorg -configure".

2) Edit xorg.conf and add this line to the "ServerLayout" section:
        InputDevice    "Mouse1" "AlwaysCore"

   Change the "InputDevice" section for "Mouse0" to look like this:

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse0"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Protocol" "PS/2"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/kdmouse"
        Option      "SendCoreEvents"
# Uncomment/set if needed:
#       Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "true"
#       Option      "Buttons" "7"
EndSection

   and add this new section:

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse1"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Protocol" "VUID"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
EndSection
                                
And just for completeness/future reference--in Solaris Express 6/05 
& newer, and eventually in a Solaris 10 update release, you should be
able to use this simplified procedure:

1) Configure either Xorg or Xsun for USB mouse as the one and only
   mouse pointer.   Use any PS/2 or USB mouse you want at any time.

 [The kernel will automatically combine all mouse devices into a single
 virtual USB mouse device, taking care of hotplugging, PS/2 vs. USB,
 and all other details behind the scenes for you.]

As I promised, there you are...

Ok... heres my solution, compiled from few online hints and tutorials...

Define your mouse like this:

---------------
Identifier  "Mouse1"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
        Option      "Buttons" "7"
        Option      "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
---------------

Mouse in my case is Logitech MX310, but who cares, 99% of new
"multiplebutton" mices works nice with  "ExplorerPS/2"... Fact is, this
mouse has additional button (8th) one, but I really do not have idea what I
would do with it :)

Next, make file named '.imwheelrc' in your $HOME with this contents:

------------------------
"(null)"
None, Up, Alt_L|Left
None, Down, Alt_L|Right

".*"
None, Up, Alt_L|Left
None, Down, Alt_L|Right
------------------------

Final step is

----------------------------------------
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 4 5"
imwheel -k -b "67"
----------------------------------------

You should place it somewhere in your startup, but AFTER X-server is started.

You may place it in ~/.kde/Autostart, or you can even modify 'startkde'
script if you are using KDE.

Of course, you will need to download imwheel for this to work, link is:

    http://imwheel.sourceforge.net

Thats it... now your back and forth buttons should work in any
application... except in krusader; krusader uses different mappings.

BTW... someone said this method is outdated... I would really appreciate
if he/she could inform us how to do it 'the more modern' way...

imwheel?  Er, that's really outdated and shouldn't be used now that

?  "modprobe uhci_hcd" or "modprobe ohci_hcd", "modprobe hid".  That's
all you need to do for kernel stuff.  X config is a little different,
like so:

Section "InputDevice"
  Driver       "mouse"
  Identifier   "Mouse[0]"
  Option       "ButtonNumber" "7"  # replace with actual button#
  Option       "Device" "/dev/input/mice" # USB mouse device
  Option       "Protocol" "imps/2" # usually the right one, but...
  Option       "ZAxisMapping" "4 5" # for scrolly-wheel

Mice with more than 5 buttons usually use the exps/2 protocol, not
the imps/2 one.  The events for buttons > 5 can be translated into
almost anything with xbindkeys and xmacroplay.

> But from what I've read, X can only see 5 mouse buttons

Not really true any longer.

> and all this 'xev','xmodmap', etc is confusing also.

xev : X event tester.  This is usually just a basic diagnostic to make
sure the mouse is responding correctly.

xmodmap : Not as useful as it should be; all it does is map single keys
to other single keys or single button presses to other single button
presses.  For anything fancy, you need:

xbindkeys : Very useful program that allows you to bind any key
combination or button press to any command you can write on a command
line at all.  Has a frontend called gtk-xbindkeys.  Useful in
combination with:

xmacroplay : Utility that uses XTest to simulate mouse and keyboard
events.  With xbindkeys and xmacroplay, you can make it so that pressing
button 6 on your mouse sends "Alt+Left" to the X server, and Firefox and
Konqueror interpret Alt+Left as "go back one page".

An MS in CS is useless for this kind of work.  No real CS person wants
to fiddle with actual hardware; that's *terribly* gauche.

Check the $HOME/.dt/sessions/current/dt.settings file.  Is there a
"ButtonMap" resource?  Does it contain the expected value of
"1,2,3,4,5" or are the buttons 4&5 both mapped to "0"?

Buttons 4 and 5 were both mapped to zero, and setting them
to the appropriate values fixed things up for me.

Thanks!

AFAIR, the next time you change mouse preferences in CDE, the file
will be corrupted once again and you have to apply the same fix for
the mapping of buttons 4&5.

Or you could re-think where the scroll wheel is placed on the mouse:

Obviously different people have different needs and preferences;
I'm not suggesting you shouldn't use whatever works best for you.

For myself, I can cope with having the scroll wheel double as the
middle button, but I'd rather have them separate.  The middle button
should be between the left and right buttons.  I'm actually not sure
where the scroll wheel should go (and I'd much rather have a wheel
than a touchpad).  Maybe the wheel could be between left and middle
buttons, or between the middle and right buttons, but that could be
awkward.  Or maybe it could be on the side, to be operated by the
thumb -- but of course that would require distinct left- and
right-handed versions.

Or possibly there should be a control that locks the wheel, so it's
either a scroll wheel or a middle button, but it doesn't try to act as
both simultaneously.

(All occurrences of "should" refer to what I'd like to see in my own
private mouse, not something I wish to impose on anyone else -- as all
the various current flawed designs are imposed on me.)

Subject: Update broke middle mouse button paste

About a month ago, an update (I am assuming this, since I did not change
any configuration files) broke the middle mouse button paste function. xev
registers buttons 1, 3 (left and right) and 4,5 (up and down scroll - the
middle mouse button on this Microsoft mouse is a scroll wheel+button) but
not button 2. This is a Debian testing + unstable install.

I am managing with Emulate3Buttons in xorg.conf but I absolutely hate having
to use this when I have a functioning middle mouse button just because of
some stupid software bug.

How do I fix this ?

Excerpt from my /etc/X11/xorg.conf :

It probably is a broken mouse (failing micro switch) if xev doesn't
show press/release events for button 2. Did you try another mouse?
Did you test the mouse on another computer or with a live CD or a
different OS?

Can you use button 2 with "gpm", outside of X on a virtual console?

Are you sure that it's not the mouse which is broken?

Did you get this to work?

My/etc/X11/xorg.conf  looks like this.

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
        Option          "Protocol"              "ExplorerPS/2"
        Option          "Buttons"               "9"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5 8 9"
EndSection

Have you looked into /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?

Subject: So weird... The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work with Xorg...

Hi, all.

I recently installed Solaris 10 on my x86 box. The only issue as I know
for the time being is that the mouse scroll wheel doesn't work with
Xorg. Hmmm... Okay, it did work, and sometimes stopped, and again
recovered. This pattern continued until about 6 hours ago. Now it stays
at the wrong state, unfortunately.

My mouse is an ordinary PS/2 one with two buttons and a scroll wheel.
I want to promise that there's absolutely nothing wrong with it per se.
Here is some info:

Incorrect protocol detected.  Should be:

BTW, I think there's a potential for things getting better, _eventually_.
I saw something about (I think)I a revision to X11 input extensions.
Until that, a device could at any given time be a core X device (with the
limitations that had), or an extension device (which could handle something
like 32 buttons and 8 axes of motion, if memory serves).  But it couldn't be
both at once.  I think the new revision will allow a device to be both at
once, so that older programs that didn't know about extension devices could
use the more limited capabilities, and newer ones could use a greater range
of capabilities.

I wouldn't expect to see that for awhile though; even once that revision is
incorporated, it wouldn't be useful to most people until toolkits and
programs were revised to take advantage of it.

But as long as the present situation holds (who knows what Oracle may do in
terms of Solaris on the desktop?), I wouldn't expect Solaris to fall too
far behind Linux (or rather, X11 on Linux or other platforms) anyway,
whatever comfort that might be.

My personal suspicion is that it might not be ten-button mice that move things
along, but more interesting devices like affordable 3D mice, datagloves,
full-body-motion trackers, etc.

I'll add that I have a logitech mouse with a single side button which
works.  I use it in my emacs to page down, and it wors "out of the
box" as autorun in WoW (through Wine).  I'm using build 115 of
OpenSolaris.

I have, as of yet, not found other uses for it.

Windows can "support" every gadget imaginable because (a) the cost is
spread out over a _lot_ of units being sold, and (b) that means that
in many cases, the hardware vendors rather than Microsoft pay for the
driver support.  (The quotation marks are because sometimes the
quality of that support is crap; you take some 3rd party hardware
vendor writing their own drivers by outsourcing the programming to
someplace where they barely speak English, and you get something
people end up complaining about; it works sometimes, and sucks the
rest of the time.)

Solaris doesn't have those advantages of scale.  Further, as long as
it (and Linux, and just about every other Unix-like OS except Macs)
uses X11 as its primary graphical interface, it's subject to the
architectural limitations of X11.  Eventually it will become less
limited, or rather, it will become so that accessing above-average
features of an input device isn't such a burden on the application
programmer.  But it isn't there yet, and I don't expect that Linux is
either.

Even on a Mac, I'd probably have a rough time finding support for a
5-button-plus-scroll-wheel mouse.  Heck, Macs have their incredible
"Magic" Mouse (where the entire top of the mouse is essentially a
touchpad).  But even though Apple invented that mouse _and_ owns the
OS, it was up to 3rd-party folks to figure out how to get gestures,
beyond just horizontal and vertical scrolling, out of it.  In that
case, it wasn't so much an architectural limitation as that Apple
(apparently) hadn't thought through and done something with the full
capabilities of the device before putting it on the market.  And for
Apple, desktops are what they do, whereas for Sun/Oracle, desktops
have fallen to a distant 2nd place in favor of servers (although some
Solaris users would say that even then, desktops have gotten too much
attention at the expense of servers...but now that I think about it,
even Apple probably does as much or more with iPhones and iPods and
the iTunes/Apps stores as with desktops...maybe desktops are on the
decline, period).

Similarly, if someone really wanted to, I bet that once Xi2 is
available, and even before toolkit (Gtk+ or whatever) support is
available to make above-average input device functionality readily
available to applciation programmers, with X11, one could create
drivers that could read all the different buttons, and a separate
program that would "grab" all functionality beyond the basics and
allow it to be mapped to known sorts of events, like accelerator keys.
That would allow the overall desktop environment (although not any
particular program in detail) to benefit from the extra functionality
of the device.

I would not however expect Sun (Oracle), or even RedHat to pay for
most of that though; and for sure, the makers of the fancy input
device wouldn't bother, since they make 99% of their money from
Windows users.  I'd expect that most of the initial work would be done
by individuals, just because they want it to happen and think they
know enough to get it done sooner themselves.

You could be one of those individuals.  Or you could offer a
bounty to someone to do the work.  Maybe you're hoping that if
you're annoying enough, someone will do it just to get you to
_shut_up_.  Tempting, but I'm sorry to say it takes less time
(and is about as much fun) to tell you where to get off than it
would take to implement a solution to your problem, which is so
not _my_ problem because I don't work for Sun/Oracle, and I don't
own a five button mouse...
