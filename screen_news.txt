  Sometimes people ask about video-signal scan converters (VGA to NTSC,
  VGA to PAL, S-Video. etc.).

  A handy source of converter, switching, and splitting devices is
  Black Box Corporation.  The on-line catalog is available in exquisite

First, you need to determine if this monitor will run at the correct
horizontal frequency for your computer.  Monitors of that vintage were
single frequency monitors and will only run correctly at the correct
h freq.  Attempting to run at another h freq will either not work or will
cause failure of some component such as the flyback transformer or both.

You can be 99% sure that you cannot change the sync by soldering in some
component.  You must adapt to the monitor.  If you cannot adapt to the
monitor, give up.

The good news is that it is easy to drive a 5 BNC input monitor with VGA
signals.  There is a 1-1 correspondance between the two standards.  You
can find the connection description in most VGA board documentation.

I strongly encourage you to purchase an adapter cable for this.  If you
attempt to solder something together, it will work but it will impact
the video clarity.  That is to say you will be looking at shadows on your
screen.  You may want to solder something together just to find out
if this monitor will work with your computer at all and then buy the
adapter cable.

good luck.

None of those monitor or multi-sync and none of them are VGA compatible.

They will use one of these three values:

Resolution	Vertical (hz)	Horiz. (Khz)	Bandwidth (Mhz)

"1024x864"         72.03	   57.38	    74.30
"1280x1024"        66.51	   70.70	   119.84
"1280x1024"        72.56	   77.17	   130.8

And sync is always on green.

I don't know what kind of monitors you're using... but if they're color, you
have a basic problem:  To render single-pixel fonts really well, you need about
two triads per pixel, and three would be preferable.  There are NO monitors
with a dot pitch fine enough and a screen large enough to provide this, not at
1280x1024 or 1024x864, not at least until you get into stratospheric pricing.

(And such monitors will be used on very-high-end CAD workstations at 1600x1200
or even 2000x1500, so you have the same problem all over again.)

If this is the problem, gamma correction isn't going to help.  If you want to
display a black pixel in between two light pixels and the dot triads on the CRT
at that particular point in the scan line happen to fall in between the pixel
times, no way will you be able to see much more than a gray blur, no matter
what the beam current is doing.  And since the pixels aren't sync'd to the dot
triads, this effect WILL happen at some points on the scan line; you can't get
away from it.

> My VCR and Televisions have such controls -- they are called SHARPNESS
> controls.

I was under the distinct impression that the sharpness control was merely a
bandwidth limiter / peaking control, while gamma correction is a modification
of the video level -> beam current transfer function, not related to bandwidth.
But whatever... it seems to me that this correction could easily be done by an
outside box, working on the R,G, and B lines.  For DEC video with composite
sync on green you'd have to switch the correction out during the sync
intervals, but sync separators are single-chip items these days... why not try
it and report back?

(meanwhile, if you want a 20" color monitor for your VAXstation that does
justice to single-pixel fonts, junk the VRT19 and buy a NEC 6FG instead.)

(And if you REALLY want sharp-edged characters in a single-pixel font, simply
use a monochrome monitor.  No "dot pitch" problems.  It'll be lots cheaper,
too.  Oh, and turn the brightness down so that the pixels don't "spill over"
onto each other.)

Ah.  I had a long conversation with someone fairly high up in NEC's customer
service organization on a similar issue.  I wanted NEC to sell service manuals,
including adjustment procedures, esp. including convergence adjustments.  Their
experience is that this is a net loss for them.  Not money-wise, but because
most shops simply are not equipped to do the job properly -- but they attempt
it anyway, leading to poor customer satisfaction, with NEC as much as with the
shop.  So they will only provide this information to NEC authorized service
companies that have completed proper training, have the necessary equipment,
etc.  I won't go into all of the details, but I started that conversation
firmly convinced that anyone with experience setting up tv broadcast monitors
could do the job, using a handy computer as a test pattern generator.  I don't
think so any more.

Another point for monochrome monitors - no purity problems from magnetic
fields.

   Yes, I knew this at the time.  Gamma correction is used to bring out the
 grey scale of some object on the screen or some part of the screen.  However,
 in the analog world the effect is the same.  Note that I said high-frequency
 gamma correction.  The sharpness control selectively amplifies the contrast
 (which effects the output of the video-level -> beam current transfer function
 by selectively modifying the video level) of small items and edges on the
 screen.  The sharpness control effectively modifies the contrast range of
 something other than the whole screen.  The IF amplifier/video detector are
 likely controlled by the TV's sharpness control, but the effect is the same
 as if it were put into the Video Amplifier.  One does not have to think of
 gamma correction as being limited to the whole screen.  It does not.  It
 can be applied to part of the screen.  The sharpness control achieves this
 dynamically, based on signal rather than screen position.  So it's a little
 bit of a matter of semantics, I guess.

   Anyway, I'm not sure I fully understand the problems of the triad of
 dots and the pixels at this time.  But what you did make clear is that
 the designers of new monitors did NOT take care to emulate effectively 
 the monitors that their new ones replace.  Perhaps they should have gone
 into the field and had a look at what people really wanted and really used.
 The 132-character screens are quite common.  How come those designers never
 come and find me?  I'n not hiding.

     With training and some equipment, I think I could.  I run a cyclotron, the

   do it.  I bet I could do it better than they could since I would have the
   time to dicker around more than they would.  I have a reputation as a real
   fusspot.  I used to do dynamic conversion on Color CRT's 25 years ago.
   The physics hasn't changed although the electronics may have changed.
   In fact, I was the first one to get a color CRT going in our 5-to-50
   gauss Control Room. (SEE BELOW)

      Indeed.  I still use the (green-screen) Dasher D400 for 132-character
  Fault Report records.  (Tilt *IS* a problem-- about 20 degrees off so we
  often rotate the deflection yokes on the crt's.)

      The degaussing coil is standard issue here.  So are a number of tiny
  little ceramic magnets.  Just protect your floppy disks, I always tell
  the operators.

There are 3 Nokia monitors people seem to get confused about.

447L: The low end Nokia 17", this is the one that costs around
      $6-700, .28mm dot pitch, 1280x1024 at 60Hz max, etc.

447X: This is the monitor you've all hearing good things about,
      and costs about $1000. .25mm pitch, 1280x1024 at 75Hz, etc.

447E: This is an OEM monitor that Nokia makes exclusively
      for Micron. It is the same as a 447X in every way
      *except* for the following:

         1) Micron sells it for about $950.00

         2) It doesn't include a couple of minor video controls

         3) the video controls have front pannel buttons/pots/etc.
            rather than an on-screen menu. I don't know if 
            the 447E video parameters are micro-processor
            controlled or not (like the 447X), no-one so far has 
            been able to tell me, not even Nokia.


I got this information after several phone calls to Nokia tech support
who'll be glad to fax you the tech sheets of each. Micron tech support
has been completely useless (on more than one issue).

I had a 447E on order, but because of the confusion, I cancelled the
447E and ordered a 447X through Computability for $979. The
only problem, however, is that the monitor arrived in 3 days and I've been
waiting 3.5 weeks already for the computer.

While these are the connections for a normal CGA, it is in fact
 capable of some sort of double-scan to 320x400 or something.

OK, here goes. Most workstation monitors are sync. on green. That means
that the horizontal and vertical syncs are combined with and subsequently
stripped from the green video signal. To combine the syncs from your
average VGA/SVGA card you need to do two things (actually I have, in 
the past, be able to just hot wire the horiz. and vert. syncs to the
green video out of the board. But, this only work with some cards and
could blow up others). 1) The syncs need to be buffered. 2) The 
signals need to be combined without loading or sourcing one another.
Start with the latter. The best way that I know to accomplish this is
to combine the signals via an AND gate. You will need either 1 three 
input AND gate or 2 two input AND gates. Now to #1. If you supply 
both inputs of an AND gate with the same signal what you get is an
isolation buffer. Hey, I'll use a quad AND gate; two gate to buffer
the syncs and two gates to combine the signals. I can also derive the 
supply voltage by putting a full wave bridge on the horiz. sync line.
After it gets filtered, I'll bet its about 5V DC. Note: use good 
LS TTLs.

Good luck.


Mark Harper


PS You'll still need to open the monitor to set the Horizontal freq.
and Horizontal phase. Most newer video boards will come close to the
original sync freq.s and phases via VESA modes, but not exactly. These
monitors are not multi-freq monitors. They will not sweep to "find"
the sync freq.s that they are sent.

As a design engineer for a terminal manufacturer for 18 years I will state
that your interference is highly likely to be magnetic.  Probably from
a distribution transformer or possibly from wiring carrying high currents
close to the PC on the other side of the wall.  This kind of interference 
is almost impossible to shield (the copper will have no effect).  You may
be able to reduce or eliminate the wiggle by turning the PC 90 degrees.
If this fails you have only one option, separate the terminal from the
magnitic source by either moving the PC or the transformer/wiring (probably
not economic!).

We had that magnetic interference in some of our offices, from a cable in
the floor. Shielding with copper had no effect. (We still tried it, it
might have worked, depending on the kind of interference).
Shielding with a special iron or permaloy must be applied if the
interference is magnetic. We bought iron shields. (Expensive! 2000 $ per
shield). It works.

Only large screens (19 Sony monitors) were seriously affected. In smaller
monitors, the electrons have a shorter distance to travel, and suffer less
deviation.

Trying Richard's idea first could be a good idea, because it is relatively
cheap, so if it does not work, little is lost.

If it does not help, however, Darrell is right: almost impossible
(aka very expensive) to shield.

Generally there are four sets of BNC connectors on the back of RGB monitors
Obviously three are for Red Green and Blue signals, one is for external
sync, but some monitors allow sync to also travel with the green channel.
There are some color monitors which had horizontal and vertical drives
separated but I also remember those same monitors could be switched into a
more conventional mode.

Your switches on the back which say 75 on one side and x on the other are
termination switches. Each of those bnc inputs has a loop-through - I guess
someone thought that you might want to hook more than one monitor to the
same output. When you are using only one monitor, always have those
switches in the 75 mode. This is 75 ohm termination. Some monitors will not
work at all if you have the switches in the wrong position and others will
look real overloaded like you have the brightness turned up too much. If
you are looping RGB signals through one color monitor to another, always
remember to terminate or flip the switches on the  last monitor in the
chain to the 75 position and leave the other monitors before that last one
in the X or "non terminated" mode. If you terminate an input twice, the
video levels will look real muddy or like the CRT is defective.

Finally, make sure the monitor has the right scan rate to support whatever
you are putting it on. If it does not, you can blow up the monitor or the
video graphics board or both. Obviously a multi-scan monitor will guarantee
that you have the right scan rate to support the graphics mode on that
display adapter.

If you can handle a soldering iron and a meter, then you can do a quick hack
like this (totally unaproved of by DEC of course).

Start off with a 15-pin D connector of the right gender to fit the monitor end
of the cable (I think you need a plug), and a 4-pin RJ11 (I think) to take the
keyboard cable.

Now : 

link pins 7 and 8 on the 15 pin D (+12V out)
link pins 4,5,6,13 on the 15 pin D (ground)

Looking into the face of the RJ11, with the pins towards you, number the
leftmost pin 1.

Now link as follows:

RJ11 pin 1 to pin 14 of the D
RJ11 pin 2 to +12V
RJ11 pin 3 to Ground
RJ11 pin 4 to pin 15 of the D

You should check those connections between the D connector and the RJ11 on your
existing VR201, in case I've noted them down wrongly

Now you need to find a composite mono monitor, capable of handling the USA NTSC
TV scan frequencies. Such monitors are relatively common, but are not used with
PCs (except as a mono monitor on a CGA card I guess). Now find a video lead to
fit the monitor input, connect it's sheild to ground on the 15 pin D plug, and
the inner to pin 12.

Plug everything in, and it should work.

Well, there is finally some good news, I think, for all those people out 
there with old fixed frequency large screen monitors, left over from 
workstations (VAX or DEC), and who want to use them on a PC.

This has always been a problem because of the fixed frequency aspect.  
DEC used to sell an ISA board for $2000 but that was excessive.

Send email to Emil Darmo at Mirage (mirage@lainet.com), which is a 
company that makes both VLB and PCI cards for handling these monitors. 
THey run around $400 ea and have a 10-day money back guarantee.

I reread your note.  I didn't notice that you had specified a VRC16.  
That is NOT a fixed frequency monitor.  It will run on a VGA or SVGA card 
just fine.

This is for the -ha version, the -da does not support mode 12


I would suggest that you just buy the cable from your PC to the
monitor from any computer store.  This is typically a stock 
item.  The monitor is marked RGBHV at the BNC port.  The way 
you described it is just fine.

As for a VRT16, this is a little harder.  This monitor does
mode 12 only and it assumes that you have sync on green.  

Most PC card do not do this.  I would carefully check your
Graphics card before you bought one of these.

For those looking for a VGA-TV converter there is one in the Oct 1991 issue
of Radio-Electronics magazine. The article name is "PC-To-TV Converter".

    Gernsback Publications, Inc.
    500-B Bi-County Boulevard,
    Farmingdale, NY. USA 11735

The article describes how to build a unit that plugs into a VGA card and
outputs NTSC video in addition to a pass-through port for VGA.

The parts list shows that a complete kit including PC board, D-connectors,
mounting hardware, all parts and converter software package - US$164.

We use ViewSonic monitors as replacements for VR290 on DecStation 3100.  The
ViewSonic monitors have BNC connections and the ability to sync on green.

From the manual - don't ask me exactly what these do as I have exclusively
used these monitors for VGA/SVGA analog video.

Mode:

      Mode         Input

       Off          TTL           General Color Mode (CGA, EGA)
       Off         Analog         General Analog Mode (VGA, PGC, etc.)

       On           TTL           Mono mode (MDA)
       On          Analog         User Programmable Memory area


Color (TTL modes only):

      Auto        CGA, EGA, or compatible 
       8           8 colors
       16          16 colors with IBM brown!
       64          64 colors

Memory Reset: Initializes to factory defaults.

Get a cable that breaks out R, G, and B to BNC's (if it has the H and
V sync lines, that's OK too, just leave them dangling).

Go to the boot prompt, this will be fun when you can't see what your
typing and type:

	set tga_sync_green 1

then type "init".  The video will then appear on the monitor.   You might
want to borrow some monitor with seperate sync to do the setup.

Subject: VR14 Inputs


The VR14 displays that I'm familiar with were part of the VC8-E Point Plot
Display on PDP8/E computers.  The VR14 was controlled by a M869 module on
the OmniBus.  In normal use the beam spot was moved to proper X-Y
coordinates with the "beam off" and then momentarily "intensified" to make
the spot visible.  Once the beam was "off" again it would be moved to the
next X-Y pair and the process repeated.  In this way you could loop through
about 1000 X-Y pairs fast enough to form an image without to much flicker.

The BNC connectors labeled Z Input and Z Select are both TTL level and work
together in the following way.  A negative going TTL transition on the Z
Input will generate a proper duration  "unblanking" pulse within the VR14
provided that:

  a. The front panel switch is in the 1&2 position, or

  b. The front panel switch is in the 1 position and Z Select is TTL HI, or

  c. The front panel switch is in the 2 position and Z Select is TTL LOW.

The duration of the "unblanking" pulse generated within the VR14 is about
300 nsec.  This pulse drives the CRT cathode from +60V to ground to allow
beam current to flow for about 300 nsec.

I believe that the Z Select may have been used to alow one controller to
drive a number of VR14 displays.  In the application that I know about
nothing was connected to the Z Select input and the front panel switch was
left in the 1&2 position.

The Z Direct input is AC coupled to the CRT grid.  To unblank the beam the
specification is a positive going pulse not exceeding 65 Volts but at lease
45 Volts for a duration of at least 1 usec but not exceeding 10 usec.  The
Z Direct input was not used in any applications that I know about.

The X and Y inputs have a sensitivity of 0.5 Volt causes 1 inch of
deflection.  Settling time for a small move is 1 usec and for a full screen
move it is 18 usec.  The M869 module used 10 bit DAC's to drive the VR14
X-Y Inputs.

In the "Small Computer Handbook" the VR14 is mentioned in the chapter on
Internal I/O Options in the section about CRT Displays.  The listing of the
Kaleidoscope program in this section is interesting.

The HP monitors which you have are called fixed frequency "as oppose to 
multi frequncy/multisync" monitors. I've heard of many gadgets that
supposingly have been designed by individuals on the net that might help 
you with one or the other aspect of the problem which  you are facing, but 
since most these gadgets offer very limited help with getting a fixed 
frequency monitor to behave as a PC compatible unit, in a little while 
you most likely will end-up searching for a better solution. After all, 
for how long you can live with "blind-booting" or not being able to switch 
to other resolutins,........ etc.

A PC monitor, should have multi-resolution capability and be compatible 
with all PC modes and resolutions. A gadget or a software trick can not
provied such compatibility and in its best, it might allow you to use
your fixed-scan monitor in one resolution only with no change-mode capablity
at all. That is if you can find a video card that can support 70+ Khz output
signal which is essential to run your HP C2094A monitor.

However, there is an alternative to all these hassles and problems: A video
card which has been designed to run a fixed frequency monitor in a multi
resolution DOS/WIN/OS2/Linux/CAD compatible environment. 

Is this an expensive solution? Not at all. Considering all the time you save
looking for a solution and spending money on practically useless gadgets and
the price comparison between a new 20" monitor and the fact that you already
have a large screen monitor, the cost of a fixed scan video card is very 
reasonable.

  The monitor wants a sync on green signal. The horz frequency is
48KHz; the vertical is 60Hz. We sell graphics cards which can drive
all HP workstation monitors from a PC. Contact me for more details.

No, this tends to cause a slow color shift, not a periodic loss of one
color.  If the image is really magenta and not pink, I would suspect that
the green gun is losing signal now and then.  Look for cold solder joints
before doing anything else but sometimes parts do become intermittent.

Intermittents are the hardest problems to find, needless to say.

RCI makes a box that connects to its Guardian controller. The APSSUN box
is about $150, but it assumes you have one of their controllers (used to
connect multiple PCs, Suns and/or Macs to a single keyboard and monitor).

Otherwise you're pretty much out of luck because the SUN frame buffer is
somewhat different than a VGA/SVA/RGB box. But -- the pinouts have
to be around someplace....you could make your own.

    Look at the top of the flyback, where it screws to the metal mount;
look for a microcrack in the plastic around the mount screwhole on the
flyback.  If you see one, your problem is a high-voltage arc.  You can
also try looking for this with the bucket off in a darkened room; you
may see a faint continuous stream of electrons making the jump.

    If you do have an HV arc problem, it will only get worse until the
fly destroys itself.  This was a common problem in the 4619; Hitachi
used to make a silicone 'boot' which form-fitted around this section of
the fly.

    The fly, if still available, is painfully expensive.

you might try Computer Component Source (Long Island, NY). They have
pretty reasonable prices on flybacks, should you need one.

You don't really need that trick on a U5 anymore; it's fast enough,
even on the console.

What's more useful is the OBP trick to set the resolution and framerate
for the console:

  setenv output-device screen:r1024x768x75

sets it to 1024 x 768 in 75 Hz. IMHO more useful than the default 60 Hz...

You cannot use just any combination though; the ATI chip has to support it. :)

I'm not as pessimistic as Bill about this (which won't surprise anyone, given
that I chaired the EVC work group in VESA, but I hope I have some reasons
beyond just that bias).  EVC can result in a cost DECREASE for the complete
system, IF the additional features it provides are needed.  Using one 
connector and cable to communicate ALL this information to the monitor will
be cheaper than using many.  Personally, I think that EVC will start to take
over as the industry moves to widespread support of the USB and IEEE-1394 
standards; you want both of these routed to the monitor (USB at a minimum, 
and 1394 if you want the monitor to provide a video camera, CD-ROM drive, or 
other high-bandwidth device).  When this happens, EVC offers a more 
cost-effective and more convenient means of connection.  And there's NO room 
left on the D-15 for these functions.

The other advantage of the EVC is in video bandwidth.  The design of
this connector makes it FAR superior to the D-15 for high-frequency video,
and in fact it is nearly on a par with BNCs in this regard.  As the 
industry moves to larger formats at higher rates, the D-15 becomes less and
less acceptable.

And if the customers want either of these - either improved video performance
or the added features and convenience - you need to start asking for them.

   obtaining the proper controller or converter is likely going to cost
   you more than the VR290 is worth.  (There are more capable multisynch
   monitors available from Digital and from other vendors -- new and used.
   The VR290 is an old first-generation workstation monitor...)

   this posting somewhere else.  I posted a couple of other URLs for other
   monitor-related sites, as well.

Basically, you'd only get 1280x1024 resolution from this setup. That
means you have to use a multiscanning PC monitor that gets up to 1280 x
1024 to set up your pc. Load the ATI utilities and drivers, then preset
the PC for the scan rate of the monitor you want to use. Restart the
computer with the multiscanner and make sure it's up in the resolution
you need, then swap signal cables with your Sony.
 
You may need to do some twiddling with the horiz. scan and refresh rates
to achieve a stable picture. These can be adjusted on the monitor's
internal circuit board ( if you're bold or experienced enough) or
possibly through the ATI driver.
 
Use another monitor

For Linux only, you can use your old card. The magic thing are the proper mode
lines in the XF86Config. (You need a second computer or terminal to connect to
the Linux computer via telnet and Ethernet or serial in order to edit the X
config. Remember, you won't see much until you have the right values.) You will
need a day until you have the proper values. Finetuning can be done with
xvidtune afterwards.

Remove all modelines except the one you are going to use - probably 1024*768 or
1280*1024.

You won't have a text mode any more, i.e., no picture until X11 has started up.

Use xdm to get an X11 based login upon boot-up. You can do everything from
xterms then. It's best to setup this before switching to the big monitor.

I'm running a Sony GDM 1934 this way with a standard Elsa 2000 AVI 4MB in
1280*1024*64k @74Hz. 73Hz or 75 Hz don't work here.

For NT - sorry, in general it won't work unless you buy a special, expensive 
VGA board that can drive fixed-frequency displays. There are some distributors
in the U.S., but I don't know any in Germany.

As far as I know the 98785A is only compatiable with the 98594A, 98547A,
and 98545A interfaces. The first two interfaces being the most modern. In
order to use the 98578 you'll need some sort of external sync conversion.

I received a few responses by e-mail... (thank you!)  In keeping with 
Usenet newsgroup protocols, I thought I'd sumarize what I found out.

Need:

A remote so-called "VGA" video terminal, set up some 200 ft away from 
its host computer.  For security and ease of cable stringing, fiber 
optic cables are desired to replace 5 coax cables presently used.

Approach:

Present SXGA (1280x1024) video cable had been split up as 5 coax cables 
(RGB/H&V), then rejoined at the remote monitor.  Fiber optic modulators 
suggested to carry the SXGA signals.  While a "composite" modulator has 
not been identified a number of manufacturers have been found who make 
suitable fiber Tx/Rx (transmiter/receiver) pairs (modulators & demods).  
These are generally designed as 5 BNC connections in, and 4 fibers out 
(H&V sync are combined on 1 fiber).

Benefit:

Fiber connections are secure, free from interference, and may be run 
over longer distances than coax.  Fiber cables are generally smaller 
than coax bundles, so may generally be run more easily.

Comment:

If security and interference are not critical issues, coax signals may 
also be effectively bundled, so one might consider more specialized, 
smaller diameter, multiconductor (bundled) coax cables in place of the 
separate (loose) cables now being used.

        Sounds like the system is set up for a Composite Video display.
does it use one BNC or RCA plug for the monitor? if so plug it into a RF
Modulator or your favorite VCR and use your television! 80 cols will suck
though. set terminal to 40 cols. or use a composit monitor (such as the
ones suggested below).
        A CGA monitor has Seperate Up-going Horizontal and Vertical
signals. three seperate Red, green and blue Digital lines and one Intensity
line. (all signals are digital). meaning a max color option of 2^4 or 15
color combinations plus black.
        to use a CGA monitor on such a system would require a custom
protocol conversion kit. possible monitor modifications (to make it a RGB
analog monitor).
        If you can find a Color Composite monitor. such as the Commodore
1701 or Commodore 1702 or the Commodore 1902 Composite/Digital RGB (CGA
Mode) monitor, you  could use it for the terminal or even  watching your
favorite movies! (monitors come with built in speakers, Seperate Y/C (S-vhs
mode, RCA to s-VHS plug cable required to hook to the y/c lines on the back
of the  Commodore 1902 or 1702 monitors.
        20 MA loop is used for longer distance Serial  transfer
connections. its similar to RS-422. (not compatible however). it uses a
current fixed signal (20 ma) to compesate for different voltage drops.
Unless you are going to use 20ma current loop. make certain that your
terminal is set for Rs-232c mode. if it does NOT work in that mode, you
will need to locate a 20ma curr loop to rs232c adaptor.

Might try a shotgun approach.   It's very likely that dead/leaky
electrolytic capacitor(s) is the source of your problems.
I'd change all the caps I could reach in the psu and line stages,
particularly if they are high voltage, low value, and
especially if they are near heatsinks or high dissipation resistors.  Any
that appear discoloured, out of shape or bulging (at the top for instance)
or appear to have leaked gunk onto the board are guilty until proven
innocent.

WARNING:
Try the following only if you have some idea what you are doing, and
appropriate safety precautions are taken.

 [[ Warning: you could get hurt trying the following ]]

If you are careful, the guilty party may be revealed by bridging a new 350v
~10uf cap across the ones in the supply, one at a time, until you see a
sudden improvement in the pix.  Remember to discharge the cap after each
bridging or you will zap something else for sure.  DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE.  If
you are not comfortable working on 300v dc switching psu circuits, while
they are energised, let someone who is do this.   Bear in mind that big caps
in Switch Mode PSU's can store a very (un)healthy (for you) amount of
energy, if you get across one that's not discharged, you will know it in a
very big way.  This CAN happen even when the unit is switched off, so watch
it.

You should also bear in mind that working on ungrounded "hot" chassis
systems is perilous without a mains isolation transformer, as you can get a
~ half mains voltage shock simply by getting between the chassis and a
decent earth, like the case of a computer.  This can ruin your whole day.
Permanently.

A general check for dry solder joints is also a good idea, but this sounds
more like caps.

I'd say either your your main HT rail is low, or the EHT is way high (less
likely).  Measure the HT as it comes out of the PSU, it should probably be
around 120v -150v or so.  If it's under a hundred, I say that was what's
upset things.
Since the monitor is basically still working, it's less likely (though not
impossible) for it to be a transisor or diode.

Hope this helps.

There are adapters available which cost less than adapter cables.
We purchased a couple of Sun 13W3 to 4 BNC cables a couple of years ago
and they cost about $80.00 each.  I think you can get adapters (either
from 13W3 to BNC or 13W3 to DB15 VGA) for US$20-$30.

Something to keep in mind is that Sun's typical video output is
1152X900@66Hz vertical, 61.8KHz horizontal.  If your monitors can't
handle this, you will be out of luck.

Also, I don't think you need to use all five of the BNC connectors.
Both at work and at home, the cables I've used have just four BNC
connectors and we have not had problems.

If you do a search of http://www.dejanews.com for this topic, you
will come across a list of adapters someone else had come with.

I use a SUN 19" GDM 1962B from 1992 with my PC. It took me a bit - but I
succeded buying a ATI 3D-Xpression graphic card and an adaptor - which wasn`t
too expensive. You need the composite sync signal from the VGA output which -
as far as I know - is only produced by ATI cards (they are also common in
Macs --> they need also csync signals). You can enable csync with the Win 9x
driver and with Xfree86.

You should know that you lose compatibility to low resolutions. There will be
no sync! I use LINUX with a graphical login therefore and when something goes
wrong you should have an old VGA-monitor aside...

Here is the pinout for the Sun 13W3 cable:

pin 10  C-Sync Ret.

You may spend lots of hours trying to patch up
cables and get some sort of limited PC compatibility
out of this monitor or up front purchase a MIRAGE video
card which supports maximum PC compatibility on a monitor
like this (Including Multiple Resolution graphics and
text in full screen mode under DOS, Win9x, NT, Linux,
OS/2,...) and is as easy to setup with this monitor
as plug-n-play.

I think the Sun's standard video output is 1152X900@66Hz vertical,
61.8KHz horizontal (I think these numbers are correct).  I doubt that
your 14" monitor is going to be able to do the above.  In the past,
many of the cheaper 17" units could not do this.

I have a Viewsonic PS790 which is a 19" unit connected to a Sun
Sparc 20 and it works with no problems.  I also have a Viewsonic
PT795 which is a 17" unit hooked up to a Windows machine which
will also work with the Sun.

At work we have a couple of Princeton E075 17" monitors connected
to Sun IPC's.  These work okay but there is a slight wiggle to
the picture in both top corners.

Maybe you can compare the specifications of these monitors to yours
and see if you can get there.

I assume you are trying to get it to work on a PC

yes it is sync on green or it will sync on HV if it has
input there.

The newer 20" (A4033A) with the button controls will
multi sync and work fine on PC's but the older ones
with dial controls such as the A2094A (I think) are
fixed res and will work on a PC but only at that resolution
try 1280X1024X75Hz or 1024x768 Dont' remember exactly
but I've used the old dial ones on PC's. they are better
for MACS though were you don't have to worry about the
resolution switching you get in DOS mode.

Not really. The 262 is a mono 1024x896 monitor. It only works with a
PMAGB-BB -- a PMAGB-BA with an auxiliary crystal the same frequency as
on the PMAG-B.  Even then it'll be in mono (using green to supply sync).

: Not really. The 262 is a mono 1024x896 monitor.

You can do what I did.  De-solder the oscillator from a PMAG-B (or find a
69.1968MHz part elsewhere), install it in the auxiliary socket on the PMAGB-B,
and set the Osc jumper to 1.

This worked great for a VR290.

All HP Systems use sync on green, that's the reason they only need
3 lines on the monitor cable (red, green, blue and hsync on green)

The older 715/XX series like 715/33, 715/50 and 715/75 had a switch
(you can see a sticker on the back that shows the dip switch settings)
to set resolution/refresh rate to 1024*768@75 Hz, 1280*1024@ 72Hz and
a greyscale mode whose rates I do not remember.

The 715/64, 715/80, 715/100, 715/100XC support about 10 different
grapic settings/ refresh rates; from std VGA 640*480 up to
1280*1024@75Hz VESA.  Std setting should be Monitor selection No. 2,
which is 1280*1024@72Hz.

The A1097[ABC] is a fixed frequency monitor, that works at
1280*1024@72Hz.

All newer HP Monitors (beginning with the A4033[ABC]) are multifrequency
monitors that should work fine on every workstation.

Some PC monitors, especially 15" up to 17" types sometimes have trouble
with the high refresh rate, they used to fail after short time.

AFAIK (and according to what you can find on the Web) this is a
multisync monitor supporting both sync-on-green (as typically used by
HP workstations) and separate sync (as typically used by PCs).  You
would only need a cable with 5 BNC connectors.

What I found on the Web is this:

  Max Resolution:        1280  1024
  H Freq / V Freq:       20-85 kHz / 50-120 Hz

If this is the 17" sibling of the A4033A (which I once owned) this
should be a very fine monitor.

I bought a couple of these for use with some VXT2000 boxes (without
monitors) that I had picked up cheap.  That is one of their original
applications in the DEC world (if you had the high-end graphics card
in the VXT).  As he says, they are *quite* nice!  With the fixed
resolution and pair of fixed frequencies and sync-on-green they are
problematic to use on PCs, but for just about any workstation or
X-window term of that era (~6 years ago?) there's a good chance this
*was* the high-end monitor offered.

The maximum length that you can extend a SVGA signal is about 1 meter (or
3 feet).  What you are experiencing is reflections and interference with
the signals on the wire.  If you get good results with anything longer,
you are lucky to have a video card with higher voltage levels or adaptive
circuitry.

A solution to a length from 1.5 meters (5 feet) and longer is a video
repeater box, where there is an amplifier and noise reducer in the middle.
I have seen some where there is an encoder on one side and a decode on
the other.  Also check out one of the new KVM devices (keyboard, video,
mouse).  Even though most KVM's are for multiple systems to a single
keyboard, monitor and mouse, they also provide longer lengths of distance
from the work area to the CPU.

Yes, it's amazing what a good quality cable can do to poor video

Matrox Tips
                  
   In order to activate sync-on-green in the Windows 95
   Millennium/Mystique driver, just change "H_SYNC_POL" to 32 in the  
   "mga.mon" file.
   (Information courtesy: Ersin Esen <eersin@ug.bcc.Bilkent.EDU.TR>)
   Andy <loneandy@privat.dk> reports using a Mystique with a Sony GDM-1950.

   This tweak has also been reported to work on the newer Millennium II
   video cards as well. If anybody has a Matrox Millennium/Mystique G200,
   please let me know if it's applicable there as well.

   Daniel McKeel is very seriously into using a Matrox card with a
   fixed-frequency monitor. He has reprogrammed the BIOS of his Matrox
   Mystique which could lead to interesting things (ie. configuring a  
   text mode for the BIOS screens, etc). He alludes to the program
   "progbios" and provides this link.

       http://grafi.ii.pw.edu.pl/gbm/matrox/biosprog.html

   What cable do I need?

   If your monitor has a 13W3 connector, you will need an adapter to go
   from 13W3 to an HD15M (VGA) connector. Several companies on the 'net
   sell these for around $30 USD each. Some even have built-in sync
   combiners which means it'd be possible to use virtually any PC video
   card with monitors requiring composite sync (i.e., Sun monitors).

   If your monitor has 3/4/5 BNC connectors, it's possible to use a 5 x
   BNC to an HD15M (VGA) cable. These are quite common as they're the
   same cable used when connecting higher-end monitors (those with BNC
   connectors) to a standard PC. These can be had from most well stocked

   of the cable.
   
   Remember that BNC monitors are either sync-on-green (3 BNC
   connectors), composite sync (4 BNC connectors) or separate sync
   (5 BNC connectors). It's also quite possible for monitors with 5 BNC
   connectors to support composite sync *and* sync-on-green, but obviously

Subject: NTSC on VGA Monitor--Quality? (Re: Bob Myers 1995 Post)

Hi!

I have been trying to figure out for several years now why video on
computer monitors looks nothing like it does on a standard TV. All the
video cards with TV tuners have dim images, hot whites, with wierd
colors. My friends do professional video editing, and while the
preview looks super on the NTSC TV, it looks bad on the computer
monitor. Initially I thought it was just a bad ATI AIW, but I also
played with a Matrox G400TV and an NEC 15" monitor and an old 1702
Commodore 14" NTSC monitor, and the NTSC output from the Matrox looked
far better on the Commodore than the NEC. I also noticed in 1991 on an
Amiga 1080 VGA/NTSC monitor that the NTSC had the same strange
quality, while the VGA was great. Reviewers always like to review all
the TV cards as just great, and also those new Viewsonic converters.
However I did see one post on some forum after an enthusiastic review
of the converter where one person described the video in the same way,
and asked if all the reviewers are blind. The answer was that the
stuff being smoked must be good...

I have looked for a technical reason for this all over, and didn't
know if it was the CRT or the electronics, and tried again today when
I suddenly found this old post by Bob Myers, an engineer, who
explained the technical differences in the tubes, and I think that's
the answer. TV screens are vastly different than VGA tubes and are
made to display bright-looking video, while VGA screens are designed
to display sharp and precise pixels.

So there is no substitute for a standard TV if you want to enjoy your
TV watching I think...? Am I interpreting Bob's explanations
accurately?

A little more on this.  It IS primarily the 2nd anode voltage which 
determines the yoke current requirements in a monitor, all else being
equal ("all else" meaning mostly the deflection angle and the sweep
rate). The current requirement goes up as roughly the square root of the
ratio of the voltages.  The larger tubes DO tend to run at higher
voltages to get sufficient brightness over the larger screen area.

And, as Sam mentioned, the max. sweep rate is a big factor; you don't
see many 17" displays designed for VGA only, so the deflection current
CAPABILITY is quite a bit greater in the larger screens, even though
there may not be much difference between the current required in a 14"
and the current required by a 17" RUNNING IN THE SAME MODE.

There's actually a considerable difference between TV and
computer-display tubes of the same size.  TV CRTs are optimized for
brightness--up to  three times or so the brightness of a
comparable-size computer-grade CRT--at the expense of spot size.  This
has an impact on the focus and other aspects of the electron gun design
(for one thing, the cathode current's gonna be higher, but you don't
need as tight a beam) plus changes to the shadow mask and phosphor
screen.  TV CRTs are usually 110 degree or 114 deg. deflection; computer
types are almost without exception 90 degree tubes. The phosphors
themselves are often of different formulations, owing to the differences
in typical white point settings and "burn" resistance requirements of
the two markets.  The fundamental operation is the same, of course, but
there are considerable differences in the design details.

Again, the basic operation is fundamentally the same, but the computer
application requires much better control of the yoke design and
assembly.  One big difference in the applications is that the TV image
is usually overscanned, which hides a lot of problems with the yoke's
effect on geometry, corner focus and convergence, etc..

...Not.  At least in going in the TV -> VGA monitor direction, the
poorer quality of the TV yoke would be readily apparent, if it worked at
all.

This assumes that the basic electrical characteristics of the yokes were
similar, which is far from a given--there are too many different types
of yokes in use, particularly on the computer monitor side of the
question.  Also, don't forget that the TV yoke was intended to run at
15,734 Hz ONLY; the VGA, at 31.5 kHz.  The VGA yoke might be from a 
multisync monitor, in which case it was designed to run FASTER than
31.5, but not slower.  It most likely doesn't match the TV yoke in any
parameter except gross appearance.

Basically, I agree with what Sam's saying above, but I'm less confident
in the likelihood of an acceptable outcome, particularly if you don't
have much experience working with the innards of CRT monitors and/or
don't have adequate test equipment to do at least some rough checks
before the smoke test.  Swapping yokes between TVs is relatively easy
and likely to work, just because there's so much similarity between TVs.
I would recommend that you not try to do this yourself--get someone
familiar at least with television troubleshooting/repair, and preferably
computer display service, to look at this for you.

It can be better, but only in part because it's "digital".  And
broadcast HDTV still suffers from some problems that will creep in, vs.
the same image had it been kept as full-bandwidth RGB, again due to the
nature of the encoding/compression systems used.

Remember, a 1920 x 1080 image at 30 frames/second - about the worst-case
data rate for HDTV - represents about almost 1.5 Gbits/second of data if
it were transmitted as 24 bit/pixel RGB.  All you can send over a
standard TV channel is a little less than 20 Mbits/second, so obviously
there's a lot of compression going on here, and it IS lossy.

Also, HDTV is a lot more complicated than just a series of JPEG images;
standard broadcast HDTV uses a variation on MPEG-2 encoding, which
encoded SOME frames in a manner similar to JPEG, while others are (to
put it somewhat simply) "made up" (or predicted) by the receiver, from
motion and predicted-frame-error information included in the transmitted
data stream.

If you look at the data rates, something less than one bit (on average)
is being transmitted per pixel of the final displayed image.  The HDTV
encoding process again gives up color resolution (vs. luminance
resolution) as compared with the RGB original (meaning that you can't
distinguish extremely fine detail from chrominance variations only), and
will also show certain artifacts (like the "blockiness" you sometimes
see with digital satellite transmissions) owing to the compression
process.  So it's still not as good as the RGB original by a long shot,
but then, the human eye is a very forgiving thing, especially under
typical TV/video conditions.

No, NTSC and PAL are both lossy (i.e., you CANNOT accurately recover the
original RGB information) due to the bandlimiting imposed on the
chrominance (U and V) signals following the matrix conversion from RGB
to YUV (prior to the bandlimiting, it WOULD be a "lossless" process, or
at least as lossless as an analog system can be).  This form of loss was
tolerated, as it results in a loss of color resolution along the
horizontal axis - but the eye has poorer color acuity than luminance
acuity anyway.  (PAL and NTSC are, in this regard, virtually identical.)
 Another source of color inaccuracy at the receiver comes from the need
to precisely recover the color subcarrier phase information, and that's
rarely done exactly, but it's not really a limiter on the system in
theory.  PAL is an improvement on NTSC in this regard, as phase errors
on alternate lines supposedly cancel each other out.  (In modern TVs,
the difference is actually negligible.)

SECAM does add a loss in the vertical axis as well, but it's no worse
than what's already being given up in the horizontal and was therefore
acceptable on those grounds.  SECAM is an utterly different encoding
system (the nickname has always been "System Essentially Contrary to the
American Method"), but in practice delivers comparable performance.

Well, it might be a loss - literally - but it was needed in
order to get color TV to fit into the same space as was
originally allocated to the "black and white" system.  And
from the standpoint of the average, modern-day TV viewer,
there's really no significant loss in the visible image quality
(assuming everything works right).


> ideal condition, without band limit NTSC will give better picture than
> SECAM?

Hard to say; if you didn't band-limit the chroma components
AT ALL, then in theory the RGB signals are fully recoverable.
That assumes no phase errors, in addition, and no significant
losses to any signals in the transmission path - so we're more
and more into the realm of fantasy.  But IF you can accept
those, then yes, it would technically be better because you'd
have no losses in the vertical direction (which SECAM forces
by its very nature).


> If I remember correct, there was a PAL.xxx ( some kind of version???)
> that does the color cheat likes SECAM (throw away 1 component every
> line), is that true?

I don't recall anything like that, but it's certainly possible.
I just don't see why, under the rest of the PAL transmission
standards, you'd ever want to do this.

And that "worst case" is never actually realized...  As I understand
it, the signal is essentially low-pass filtered to 1400 (or so)
horizontal, and is also filtered vertically, to avoid interlacing
artifacts, giving an effective resolution of about 750x1400 (not a
whole lot higher than 720p's 720x1280).  Still better than what most
consumer HDTV's are capable of...

Hi!

I've recently got hold of a VT420 which was way too dark also.
I was able to correct this by following the guidelines given in
the VT420 service guide available from

    http://www.vt100.net/

There is also a "VT330 Pocket Service Guide" which is probably
applicable to the VT340 too (although I don't know for sure).

The basic steps necessary were:

- Set front brightness to max and contrast to min

- Adjust the "Screen" control, which is located inside the terminal,
  until the screen content almost disappears, but is still visible

That made my terminal shine very bright again. Maybe the VT340 has a
similar control.

Regards
Matthias

fbconfig is your friend

to get a list of possible resolutions fbconfig -res \?

take note of the ones with a attached 'd', those are designed for LCD
displays.

After setting the desired resolution, logout and in again to benefit
from it.
