Subject: Scrollbar problem

Running a test program on VMS which launches dbg which displays on
a laptop running XP/Excursion and I get following warning on the
VMS side (actually on a PuTTY window on an W2K server to the VMS box)

                               X Toolkit Warning:
     Name: src_vert_sbar
     Class: XmScrollBar
     The specified scrollbar value is greater than the maximum
     scrollbar value minus the scrollbar slider size.

Anybody know where I fix this?  is it VMS, Excursion or PuTTY?

Google indicates that Excursion is an X GUI (most likely).

PuTTY is not (it's a native Windows app).

There might be some VMS app that you're running inside Excursion.

SOLVED:

The Xaccess XDMCP mechanism governs a remote Xservers
access to local X clients.

After a night's sleep  I realised that  Xvnc is not remote
at all.  Xvnc is alocal Xserver, just as Xsun is !

To allow Xvnc  through  the XDMCP Xaccess mechanism
the Xaccess file  needs to be populated with the entry:

   " localhost "

Well, I can't be certain without the actual error messages, but I
suspect that this is related to X authorization (and not file
permissions....well at least not directly).

By default, openwin uses what's called "MIT Magic Cookie"
authorization to ensure that unauthorized individuals aren't able to
open connections to your X server (that's the process that directly
controls your monitor and reads your keystrokes and mouse movements).
A randon number is created when X starts up---this is the cookie---
and is stored in a file in your home directory called .Xauthority.
This is not an ASCII file, but you can see the contents of this file
with the command "xauth list".  When an X client opens a connection to
your server, it must present this cookie before the server will allow
the connection to complete.

Therefore, anyone who can open and read this file can open connections
to your X server.  Which is why it is protected so that only the owner
can read it (mode 600).

This all works fine as long as the X client application knows WHERE
the file is.  And herein lies your problem (I think).

When you do "su - root", you have instructed su to alter the
environment.  As the man page for su says: "the environment will be
changed to what would be expected if the user actually logged in as
the specified user."  This would include $HOME.  Any X application
that gets started after this would try to get the cookie out of
.Xauthority in root's home and would fail miserably.

As someone else suggested, if you run "su root" instead, $HOME will
not be altered and the correct .Xauthority file will be located.

Note, however, that if the original home directory was located on a
remotely mounted file system, chances are good that root will not be
able to read the file and will still be unable to open the connection
to the X server.

There are at least two ways an X application can display fonts.

It can make use of the font files the X server has available or it can
display bitmaps, essentially creating its own fonts. I'm not very familiar
with texx, but I suspect it does the latter, based on the left-right
reversal you are seeing.

Font Files
----------
In the case of font files, each server uses fonts in the Server Normal
Font (SNF) format. These can be unique to the server, and are analogous
to compiled C programs. Binaries from one machine seldom run on
a machine with a different architecture.

Fonts in Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) are analogous to C source code.
They can be compiled into the HP 700/X snf format with the xtbdftosnf
utility, supplied with the 700/X software.

If you have workstation fonts in the snf or scf (compressed) format for
that workstation, they can be translated into 700/X snf format with the
xtsnftosnf utility (again, supplied with the 700/X software).

Bitmaps
-------
I'm not an Xlib jock, but I have bumped into other applications with
the same left-right reversal symptom. The problem occurs when displaying
a bitmap created on a machine with different byte ordering.
Programmers sometimes use a call such as XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData.
The recommended way is to do it in several steps.

1. Use XCreateImage to create an XImage structure.
2. Set the bitmap_bit_order and byte_order fields in the XImage stucture
   to match the machine that the bitmaps were created on.
3. Use XPutImage to output the bitmap.

Please let me know how you make out.

I saw basically the same problem when I upgraded from 10.01 to 10.20.  This
is what the HP Response Center told me.  It seems a little hokey, but it
works.

First, verify that the font-server has been added to your font path using:
"xset -q".  Look for an entry "Font Path:  tcp/<ipaddress>:7000".
If this is not present, you can add the font-server to the current
session using: "xset fp+ tcp/<ipaddress>:7000".
The "Missing charsets ... " error is most likely due to older
applications being run/displayed on you Xserver.  CDE (& VUE @ 10.x)
sets font resources using a "fontset" notation.  You can see these
resources by running: "xrdb -q | grep -i font".  You will notice that
some of these resources have a trailing ":".  Older clients that either
have a static copy of Motif/Xlib or are being displayed from a 9.x
system (ie, sam, gpm, etc) do not deal with these resources very well.
As a suggestion, you can try stripping the trailing colon from those
entries using this command:  "xrdb -q | grep Font | sed s/:$//g|xrdb
-m".  If this works, you can setup your session to run this command
automatically when loggin in.  Create the file
"$HOME/.dt/sessions/sessionetc" containing the command and change the
permission bits to be executable: "chmod 755 sessionetc".

Hope this helps,
Aaron

Subject: X Windows Security Flaws


Security Flaw:
	XGrabKeyboard does not prevent apps from using XQueryKeymap to poll
the keyboard.  The result is that programs can find out what is being typed
even while under xterm secure mode or xdm login (if it was set up not to use
XGrabServer(), which is likely the case).  I figure this isn't too big of a
deal because the x keyboard extension will do the same thing, I believe. 
However, it works on every X system I've tried, extensions or not.

Security Concern:
	By changing the keymap, an application can effectively 'tell' the
user what to type;  make all keys translate to the next key you want to be
typed (you want the user to type 'a', so you make every key be the 'a' key). 
This works reliably on my 20 mips DECstation at typing speeds, so I imagine
on newer computers it would work flawlessly (speed is an issue because after
you tell the Xserver a new keymap, the clients have to 'ask' for an update).

Both of these only work if you can get a connection to the X server, so they
aren't really a major problem.  So, does anybody have any objections to me
posting programs that demonstrate these two examples?

xfs in those defines Xcalloc - it was just the backports to S8 and S9 that

Subject: DECwindows over CMU TCP/IP (it works!)

I just wanted to let the general VAX/VMS public know that CMU TCP/IP
now is capable of supporting DECwindows applications with
DECW$TRANSPORT_CMU.EXE (actually DECW_TRANSPORT_CMU.EXE to be
precise). An HP-UX X client (Xclock) displayed quite nicely on a
VAXstation II/GPX running DECwindows and CMU TCP/IP v6.4  with the
recently-posted DECwindows transport. The converse also worked:
DECW$CLOCK on the VAX displaying on the HP-UX server.

For those who haven't given it much thought yet, the implication is
that one can purchase a *color* X terminal from a vendor that only
supports TCP/IP in their hardware and use it with the VAXen. VT1000's
are nice, but they are slow and they are monochrome. And on the PC
front, while I haven't *quite* succeeded in getting an MS-DOS-based X
server to interoperate with DECwindows over TCP/IP, I *have* gotten as
far as logging into the VAX via DECW$STARTLOGIN. I think the problem
I'm having is client/server security now. Stay tuned...

The CMU stuff is discussed on the CMU-TEK-TCP Internet mailing list.
Requests to CMU-TEK-TCP-REQUEST@andrew.cmu.edu, I believe.

	The UIL compiler is documented in the VMS Decwindows docset,

  It's an X Windows thing. It describes the files needed to build an app-
lication, but in an OS-independent manner. It gets run through a prepro-
cessor which adds _lots_ of comment lines 8-) and converts it to a makefile
for a target environment.

  I generally look at them to see what sources are used, and then I write 
a BUILD.COM file for VMS and punt the makefiles.

Subject: Part # for OSF/Motif VMS

A few days ago, someone posted a question asking how to obtain OSF/Motif for
VMS.

Well, the part number now exists, and you can buy it from DEC or its
distributors. It is QA-YMAAA-H5 (or H8 for CDs) and the TK50 list price is
$431. You do need a license for each CPU where the Motif WM is going to run,
and the cost of that license is tied to the CPU, like in any other of DEC's
layered products. For a MicroVAX II, the license (QL-YMAAN-AA) is $183 list.

In regards to the license, interestingly enough the Ultrix license does cover
the OSF/Motif WM (yet not a reason to switch over from VMS...)

Subject: Re: Spectragraphics X-terminal w/ DECwindows

In article <1991Jun28.123729.27467@eagle.lerc.nasa.gov>, uugblum@ariel.lerc.nasa.gov (Greg Blumers) writes:

#Does anyone have experience running DECwindows on a Spectragraphics LS800
#X-Terminal.  One of our VAX users had the misfortune of purchasing two of
#these.  He can't create a DECterm window.  From what I have seen on other
#third party window terminals, it probably is due to the lack of DEC fonts.
#Any ideas? 

One test to see "what is going wrong" with DECterm is to do the following:

$ SET DISPLAY/NODE=foo/TRANSPORT=bar/CREATE
$ SPAWN/NOWAIT RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DECW$TERMINAL 
$ CREATE/TERMINAL

The SPAWN command is so you can see the output from the Terminal Controller
(DECW$TERMINAL).  If it decides to crash, you will get some indication as to
"why".  Assuming that other utilities (Clock, Ico, Mail, Etc) work, I would
assume it's a font problem.

Now the important trick is...  how do I fix this mess ?

The "best" solution is to either load the missing fonts on to the X terminal,
or establish an alias for it.  DEC provides a FONTS.ALIAS file examples in
DECW$EXAMPLES:

Assuming that you can't do either of those, you can force DECterm to use other
fonts.  This is Unsupported/Undocumented/Uneverything...  but it seems to work.

Create a defaults file for the Terminal Controller in your SYS$LOGIN directory. 
The file name is DECW$TERMINAL.DAT, do not confuse this with
DECW$TERMINAL_DEFAULTS.DAT !!!

In this file, enter two resource entries with fonts that you know are on the X
Terminal.  For example, the quick test I just came up with is:

#
# Large font search list
#
*bigFontSetName:    -*-*-*-*-*--24-*-*-*-c-*-*-*
#                   
# Small font search list
#
*littleFontSetName: -*-*-*-*-*--14-*-*-*-c-*-*-*                   

The "big" versus "little" is chosen in one of the customize pull-downs.
The "c" indicates you want a font with fixed spacing...  the numbers (I
believe) are pixel sizes.  Keep in mind that whatever font you choose, it will
need a "medium" weight and a "bold" weight to work properly.  Experiment with
various fonts to see if you can come up with a FontSetName that DECterm can
live with!

Good Luck!

I am assuming that you are using a serial mouse since you said that you
tried a different port (unless you have more that one mouse board in your
system).  Are you sure that your serial ports are configured into the
kernel.  Someone may have deconfigured one or both of you serial port in
order to install another option.  Check the file
"/etc/conf/sdevice.d/asy" the second field of at least one of the lines
in this file should be "Y", if not or if this file does not exist you
may not have any serial ports configured on your system.

I hope this is of some help,

Well, there's not much out there.  The only place we found was Hands
on Learning in Boston, 800-248-9133.  We did get offers from several
other places to do a live class here and allow us to tape it.  That's
probably too expensive and we will likely go with HOL.

The National Technological University in Ft. Collins Colorado (303)
484-6050 does satelite uplink classes, and they said they might be
willing to tape one and sell it to us, but I haven't gotten enough
details from them as far as terms etc go, yet.

Thanks to everyone who responded.

I'm currently using a program called MicroX from Starnet Communications.
It supports 256 color or mono.  With resolutions up to 1024x768.  And
they include networking software (NCSA packet driver & software).  The
cost is only $345 for the 386 version and $195 for the 286 version.

I use olwm for my window manager.  This makes my PC look just like a
Sun.  I use OpenWindow's Deskset tools and Valid's CAE tools.  It all
works great.

For more info you can contact Greg Mudge at Starnet.  His phone number
is (408)739-0881 and his E-mail address is mudge@starnet.com

Good Luck,
Ken

Well, you're basically looking at buying an NCD (Network Computing Devices)

Tektronix' X terminals can support running X over serial lines using
Serial Xpress. Here is a brief overview of Serial Xpress.

Simply stated, Serial Xpress is a means by which X applications can be run
on a remote computer over RS-232 lines with resonable performance. SXp is
easy to use and install. SXp was designed to meet the needs of those persons
that would like to run X from a remote location. SXp does not run on top of
any existing protocols like SLIP, or PPP, but instead has a transport protocol
built in.

In X terminology, client applications make requests to the server, and the 
server sends replies to the client. In order for X requests and replies to be 
transmitted with reasonable performance over a serial line, they must be 
compressed, and request and replies from different clients must be interleaved
on the line. This is how SXp works. Basically, a process is run on a host that 
becomes the X terminal's "PSEUDO SERVER". This is where all the X requests that
would normally be sent to the terminal are routed. The "PSEUDO SERVER" takes 
the X requests, compresses them, multiplexes the requests for different clients,
and transmits them to the X terminal. The X terminal also has a process running 
internally that demultiplexes requests for different clients,decompresses those 
requests, and sends them to the true X server. The process running on the 
terminal also compresses and multiplexes the replies for transmission. 

By the way it is much faster than Xremote and can support network and serial
connections simultaneously.

But Xremote is widely used and also available on PCs and in some terminal
servers. Serial Xpress may be technically better but is it going to get
the market acceptance that will make it worthwhile? I personally will
prefer a product also available on the PCs, while waiting for some
standards committee to define some international standard which might
or might not be an existing de facto standard and might or might not
then take over the world. I know there is such work going on somewhere,
but I don't remember the details.

The newest version of XTERM for VMS, version 2.1, has just
been made available, thanks to the good work of Patrick
Mahan of TGV.  XTERM supports VT102 and Tek 4014 emulation.

I'm not sure what all goodness is newly implemented in this
version.  However, it is NOT "8-bit clean".  XTERM V2.1 
requires MOTIF.

XTERM is available via anonymous FTP on Arizona.EDU (preferred
target host: Osprey.Telcom.Arizona.EDU [128.196.128.232])
in the file [software.vms.xterm]xterm021.bck.
If your FTP client is incapable of negotiating VMS file structure,
then FTP the saveset in binary mode and use a utility such as Joe
Meadows' FILE to set the recordsize to 2048 bytes.

I will NOT e-mail this saveset to those who lack Internet access.
Perhaps a VMS mailserver site may wish to provide access.

P.S. If you are running DECwindows rather than Motif, and are
running at least VMS V5.4, then you can use XTERM012.BCK
instead.  This saveset has a recordsize of 4096 bytes.  I believe
that XTERM V1.2 requires the presense of the TW/PYdrivers.

You can use EWS-Software and run nearly any VAXStation as an X-Terminal.
But you'll need at least 6MB of memory in your VAXStation 2000 for this.
The EWS-software won't boot with less. EWS V1.2 runs pretty good here.
EWS won't use any connected disk or other device (except keyboard and 
mouse :-)). Creating VMS... Well, you have 1VUPS in VS2000, concider running
MOTIF Server and Client on this little thing. I'd prefer buying a 4MB-card for
your VS and go for it.
Hope that helps

One thing that you may want to inquire about (we found out the hard way) is 
that the VXT's (and moste likely any x terminal you get) suck up mucho cpu 
cycles on the Vax in JUST PAINTING THE SCREENS.  We had a dozen users who  
used vt420's for dual sessions (1 order entry, and 1 All-in-1).  They used a 
moderate amount of cpu time.  Now they are using 20% of one of our machines 
(6510).  The order entry screens (2) paint data constantly to the screens, as 
well as have flashing areas.  THe DECW$TERMINAL.EXE image has become the top 
cpu image (over ALL-IN-1  and the order entry stuff).  Dec's response 9after 
selling us the terminals) is that "is to be expected".  Grrrr.  No one ever 
even hinted that we would suffer such a change (we were expecing some useage 
increase, but no THAT much).

I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you... this isn't a "bug" - it's a
feature ;-)


DEC for some reason refuses to implement the MIT MAGIC-COOKIE routines
which allow a sort-of end-user X security. Under DECwindows (for example),
you have the option with DECnet of allowing usercode MYNAME on node
NODENAME to access your display (under the Security menu). With TCP/IP,
you have to specify a wildcard for the usercode - i.e. any user on TCP/IP
node MYNAME can output onto your display. The MAGIC-COOKIE stuff (I'm a
user - not a guru in case you haven't noticed ;-) involves you giving to
the usercodes you want to be able to access your display a special file
that contains a "password-like" phrase that they must show the server
(your display) before actually being able to connect.

Hence it allows you a similar level of protection for TCP/IP as already
exists over DECnet (DECnet uses a completely different authentication
scheme - after all, the person's usercode is passed in each packet!).

I can attest that this "problem" exists under X11R5 - but as only Un*x
boxes here use R5 - they all have MAGIC-COOKIE protection and everyone
lives happily ever after :-)


BTW: xkey is nasty - it certainly allows you to grab passwords/etc... If
you run X11 - you _should_ run MAGIC-COOKIE

These are two different programs, xwatchwin2 gets a copy of what's on
the screen (like xwd) and xkey gets all the keys pressed. xkey is more
dangerous because it can record the passwords you type.

Both programs work in all versions of X (including X11R5) because they
do not exploit a bug but only design features.

Wrong!!! A trivial enhancement to xkey (as it was posted) allows to
ignore the "secure terminal" option. This option is useless and does
not protect anything. Don't rely on it!

BTW, xterm as an option called "secure keyboard" that does the same
thing (and is therefore also useless).

In conclusion, if you allow someone to access your display then he can
do anything: read the screen and record every key you type.

The ONLY solution is to restrict the access to your display, by using
xauth and the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE for instance.

Hummingbird Communications Ltd. of Ontario, Canada offers a nice package
called HCL-eXceed for running x-windows on a PC.  We have two PC's running
this way and are quite satisfied (especially for the price!).  The biggest
hangups are the install and the monitor resolution.

Call Hummingbird at (416) 470-1203.

Try hummingbird technologies for x-terminal software which works
under windows.  This package seems to be the most popular and works
quite well.  There is also a package called Xvision from VisionWare
which is quite good.  Visionware's phone number is 415-325-2113.

Whoa there!  The "S" in SLIP stands for ** SERIAL **, not subscriber.  Also,
it's not that simple; you need something to connect to on the UNIX end, not
just the standard shell.  Also, if you're rolling your own, you might do
better with PPP rather than SLIP.

If you're not inclined to roll your own, I note that NCD advertises a serial
line based X emulator for PCs in recent UNIX magazines, and (if memory serves)
the price is less than US$200.

Remember, you need clean lines and V32/V42 bis communication speeds and
protocol to make it worthwhile.  You also generally need hardware flow control
as XON/XOFF is not an option in 8bit communications.

What some people have done to get around the relatively "fat" X protocol on
the relatively skinny serial line is to put much of the X server on the UNIX
host, then use a skinny protocol to do the actual communications with the
X terminal.  I've seen GraphOn's serial X terminal that works this way;  it's
quite responsive, but it does unload a fair bit of processing onto the host.

I should close by noting that these topics are covered in much more detail and
accuracy in comp.windows.x and related newsgroups...

First, SNF stands for "Server Normal Format" and BDF stands for "Binary
Distribution Format".  As the name implies, SNF is server specific, so it
is up to each manufacturer to define what SNF is, hence (probably) the
inability of SNFtoBDF to read them.

X fonts are normally distributed in BDF, and you really need to get the
BDF versions if you want to use them with MacX.

I have no idea on the availability of DECwindows fonts in BDF...  Anybody else?

Why not just using Linux? That gives you both: an X-Windows front end and
a reasonable PC Unix. And it's free for any resolution.

While I can't speak for Exceed, Tektronics and NCD both have products
that do X over low speed serial lines (still, 9600+ is _very_ recomended).
They both do extensive compression of the X protocol, in the same spirit as
Van Jacobson's TCP/IP header compression, which reduces headers to an average
of under one byte by aggressively recoding the protocol to remove redundant
data.  See rfc 1144 for more info.

Low Bandwidth X (LBX) is a proposal to combine and standardize the NCD and
Tektronics protocols and merge them into X11R6.  See issue 5 (Winter, 1993)
of "The X Resource" for more detailed information on this.

I use Visionware's XVision5.  Run's under Windoze 3.1.  Very nice, very
easy to install.  Could be better in the documentation but what's not
in a manual is hidden in the online Help.

Call Roy Caudill at Visionware for more info:

800-949-8474.

You may want to look into NCD's patched up xterm.  Supposedly it was supposed
to be the standard xterm in X11R5, however I'm not sure if it made it.
Anyway, it takes care of the poor performance of an xterm under vi.  I run
XRemote, NCD's X over serial lines and using a traditional xterm with vi was
just murder.  I built NCD's patched up version and it vastly improved
performance.

For others interested in the same thing:

There are MANY products available including
PC Xware from NCD
Xvision
eXceed/Xpress from Hummingbird

All run under Windows and generally work well. Modem speed is
key. The faster the better. eXceed works (supposedly) under NT.
The NCD product doest. NCD also doesn't like Cyrix based cards.
NCD and (I think) Xvision support mouse follow focus. NCD
has a nice window manager.

I installed PCXware from NCD on two laptops (486/24-33). One has
an internal 14.4 modem, mine, has the Microcom Deskporte FAST
14.4 modem. It works GREAT! It is an evaluation copy and it looks
like I will be purchasing 5-8 copies. BTW, I received, for evaluation,
copies of Hummingbird's eXceed/Xpress AND Chameleon/X. I have
not had a chance to install and evaluate the former. I am so
satisfied with PCXware, that I don't think I will spend the time
to try them out. :(   :)

I am able to run xremote off my Terminal Server (Cisco) and have
multiple sessions. Last night, I had four clients plus my Sunos 4.1.3
Calendar Manager up. I have also brought up MailTool (Sunos 4.1.3).
If you are system administrator or Power User, I highly recommend
PCXware.

Check eXceed vs.  Xware by looking at how responsive
mailtool is. In particular, try typing a reply in
mailtool. At least at one point, eXceed had real problems on
some PCs. Also, monitor cpu usage of Xremote vs. sxprocess 
(Hummingbird). We saw sxprocess chewing up a lot more of the cpu.

I am glad there is X.  I use it every time I have to explain "client-server" or
"distributed processing" to anyone.  Because X works backwards.
 
Most people, no matter how carefully you explain the client-server concept, get
hung up on the notion that the "server' is always "the big box,"  "their box,"
or "the far away box," with the "client" being "the small box," "my box," or
"the close box."  This is because most examples have to do with services that
involve "their" file server, a "big" compute server, or a "far away" data base
server.  It is extremely useful to be able to describe the user interface as a
service which other computers use as clients.
 
Here, then, is the definitive guide to programming with X, or, more formally,
the "X Window System", or, more commonly but less properly, X-Windows.  (I had
originally assumed that this latter reference was possibly due to some
confusion with the Digital specific implementation and extension, DECWindows. 
Digital equipment and personnel have played a large part in the birth and
development of X.  However, Robert Scheifler saw references to X-Windows before
the DECWindows product existed, and thinks it must be due to an assumption that
the naming followed the "Microsoft Windows" form.)
 
Part of the popularity of X is the fact that there is a considerable library of
routines ready made for implementing X systems.  Part one of the book,
therefore, starts with sixteen chapters detailing the available libraries by
function.  Part two then defines the formal X Window System protocol.  Part
three deals with inter-client communications conventions, while part four
discusses fonts.  There are nine appendices and a glossary.

Look at 8 1/2, the plan 9 windowing system.  Incredibly elegant and
easy to use.  This is the first windowing system that fits me, instead
of me working around the lossage.

Some plan 9 papers are available in ftp://research.att.com under
plan9doc and plan9man.  I have no current status if this is available
outside of universities.  We have just got the CD and I am enjoying
life.

Actually all your complaints above are addressed by plan 9.  Small,
fast, portable, and quite possibly doomed to faliure.
