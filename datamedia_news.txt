The DataMedia Corporation made a series of video terminals, the Colorscan/2,
which were based on IBM-PC-like hardware.  They could function either as
a colorized VT100 or as a PC/XT computer.  (VT220 and VT241 options were
also available.)

In 1993, this address was valid:

   Datamedia Corporation
   20 Trafalgar Square
   Nashua, New Hampshire 03063
   voice: +1 603/886-1570

As of early 1996, it appears that Datamedia has been taken over by:

   Axent Technologies, Inc.
   2400 Research Boulevard
   Rockville, Maryland 20850
   voice: +1 301/258-2620
     fax: +1 301/330-5756
   email: <info@axent.com>

makers of OmniGuard client/server security software.


Recommended CRT settings:

   TTL/ANALOG     TTL
   MANUAL         Off

   COLOR          DIP-5    DIP-6
    8-color       Off      on
   16-color       Off      Off
   64-color       on       Off
   (n/a)          on       on
 
   TEXT/COLOR     don't care
   
If you have the VT200-style keyboard, set the keyboard switch to "1".


To get from MS-DOS to the Setup Menu, press

   <Ctrl><Alt><Ins>             (where <Ins> is the same as Keypad-0)

otherwise, press F3.


The RAMfile option uses four 1.2-V NiCd battery cells on the daughterboard.
However, the battery-powered CMOS RAM chip is located on the motherboard.
(Looking from the rear of the unit, it is the rightmost of four large chips
under two large chips.)  If the password for Power-On Security has been 
lost, unplug and then replug this chip.

ColorScan color sequences are of the form  Esc [ nn m

where "nn" is:

       Foreground   Background
Black      10           20
Blue       11           21
Red        12           22
Green      13           23
Yellow     14           24
Magenta    15           25
Cyan       16           26
White      17           27

In addition, some models may be able to do ISO-DP6429/ECMA-48 color.

A short while back a request was posted for details of the soft switch
settings on Datamedia DT80's.

I tried emailing to the poster, but failed. Grrrr!

Here is the info.

The soft switches are in banks of four

1	0=Jump  1=Smooth
	Autorepeat 	0=off  1=on
	Screen		0=Dark 1=light
	Cursor		0=u/l  1=block

2	Margin Bell	0=off  1=on
	Keyclick	0=off  1=on
	Ansi/VT52	0=VT52 1=Ansi
	Xon/Xoff	0=Off  1=On

3	Shift3		0=Hash 1=UK Pound
	Wrap		0=Off  1=On
	Newline		0=Off  1=On
	Interlace	0=Off  1=On
	
4	Parity		0=Odd  1=Even
	Parity		0=Off  1=On
	Bits/Char	0=7    1=8
	Power		0=60Hz 1=50Hz

5	Line Interface  0=EIA  1=Loop
	Aux Interface   0=EIA  1=Loop
	Local Copy    	0=Off  1=On	
	Spare

6	Aux Parity	0=Odd  1=Even
	Aux Parity	0=Off  1=On
	Aux Bits/Char   0=7    1=8
	CRT Saver	0=Off  1=On
	

Hope that's enough!  The speed settings run from other keys on the
setup.  If the poster *really* wants a manual can he/she send me
her/his snail-mail address & I'll post a spare.

BTW These were very good terminals in their day - but of course time
marches on!

The Datamedia Elite 3000 could be a 3025, 3052, 3045.   The data rates
are selectable through a set-up, can't remember the code.   Pretty
sure the 'EIA' button should be in and 'tape' definately out.  If I
can dig up a manual I might post more info.  I worked for Datamedia.
