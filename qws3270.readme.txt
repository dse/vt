  Please note that this is shareware, and is produced as an enhanced 
  version of the base QWS3270 product which is freeware.  These 
  enhancements were added on my own time, thus the charge to get a 
  modest return for my time and to re-gain some of my investment in 
  hardware and software. There is no warranty, either express or implied,
  of the suitability of this product for any purpose whatever.  See the 
  register.txt file for registration instructions.
