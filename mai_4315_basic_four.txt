                          *** General Information ***
The DT-4315 Dual Universe Terminal replaces both the DT-4313 and DT-4314
terminals (which are no longer available).

The DT-4315 is a dual port terminal (compatible with the DT-4314) with many new
features including:

 o DEC VT-100 terminal emulation
 o includes Desk-Top ultilities
 o uses a PC-type keyboard
 o utilizes RJ45 serial port connectors
 o 14" screen

Issue   : Optional Tilt/Swivel
          Base Assembly

Type    : Informational

The Optional Tilt/Swivel Base is an OPTIONAL item, it does not automatically
come with the terminal and must be ordered separately (KG020Z, 400781-003).  In
the first shipments of the DT-4315 terminals the installation instructions were
inadvertently included in with the terminals.  This situation has been correcte
and all future shipments of the DT-4315 terminals will not include these
installation instructions.

Issue    : Hardware Flow
           Control

Type     : Informational

The hardware flow control for the DT-4315 terminal is slightly different from
that of the DT-4314 terminal.  The DT-4314 supports the full set of flow
control lines, which includes RTS, CTS, DSR, and DTR.  The DT-4315 in using the
RJ45 connector only supports DTR and CTS.  This is not an issue when connecting
the DT-4315 to any of the MAI systems, (GPx, MPx, or SPx), but it may present a
problem when trying to connect the DT-4315 to other system types that monitor
Pin 4 RTS instead of Pin 20 DTR when using Hardware Flow Control.  In cases
like this there are 3 possible solutions:

        1- Configure the system port for Xon/Xoff Flow control instead of
           Hardware Flow Control.

        2- If using the DB25 to RJ45 adapter cable 916794-001, you can modify
           it by moving Pin 20 (DTR) to Pin 4 (RTS) on the DB25 side.

        3- Modify the system data cable at the system end by
           jumpering Pin 4 (RTS) and Pin 20 (DTR) together.

     *** Unable to save PF keys - perform MASTER RESET from set-up menu ***

SYMPTOM: Unable to save PF keys as 'permanent', PF key lost after cycling power
PROBLEM DETERMINATION: If a message "HOST CHANGED FUNCTION KEYS. RESTORE SAVED
                       VALUES [n]/y" appears when Programmable Function Keys is
                       selected from the MAIN Setup menu, there may be modes
                       set which will not allow PF kets to be saved.

FIX: Select TERMINAL MANAGEMENT from the MAIN Setup menu, then select MASTER
     RESET. This will reset EVERYTHING including PF keys, follow the         
     instructions in section 7 of the 4315 VDT User Guide to set the PF keys as
.
     desired.

NOTE: This condition can be set in the MAIN LOGIC PCBA, could be this way from
      stock requiring a MASTER RESET to clear. It is probably a good idea to
      perform a MASTER RESET after replacing a MAIN LOGIC PCBA.

      Other functions may not work correctly due to host escape sequences or
      noise into the port, a MASTER RESET should clear any inadvertent modes
      set in NVRAM.

Revision B Firmware

Type:   Informational

Purpose:  Delay in the Revision B Firmware release.

Cause:  Two problems have been found with the Rev B firmware.  One problem does
.
        not affect customers.  The second problem is that data may be lost when
        slave printing to a PT-4229.  The 4229 is the only printer this problem
        has been seen on, but all printers have not been verified.  A system
        running with low usage is more likely to see the problem because data
        is being sent to the terminal more rapidly.

        Because of these problems there will be a Revision C which is scheduled
        to be released very early in November.

Caution: Some new DT-4315s have been shipped with Revision B, so at this time
         avoid attaching 4229s to these terminals.

                      *** Keyboard Cleaning and Repair ***

Most of the keyboards sent back to Tustin for repair require only cleaning or
minor repair, procedures which can easily be accomplished in the field.

1. Cleaning and simple repair should be attempted on ALL keyboards at the field
   level. This covers both "switch-type" keyboards, as well as "membrane-type".

   Keyboards should be repaired on-site, and where this is not possible, brough
t

   back  to the office or stocking location and cleaned/repaired there.

   In general, the keyboards can be repaired by disassembling them, blowing-out
 
   or brushing off dust and debris, cleaning the PCBA using a foaming-type
   window cleaner (like aerosol Windex), brightening contact points by rubbing
   them with an eraser (Pink Pearl), and replacing any worn-out springs or pads
   Even the newer-style membrane keyboards (such as the DT4315, PSx30, etc.)
   usually fail because of dust or liquid contamination between the membrane
   layers preventing a key from making contact. Disassembling these keyboards i
s

   equally easy and the membranes can be cleaned by wiping them with a soft
   cloth dampened with window cleaner.

2. Several hundred keyboard repair kits were distributed throughout the field
   in the past. Replacement parts for these kits can be ordered through
   Tustin, part numbers are as follows:

     Parts for 7270, 4309, and 4312 keyboards.
         Spring, Spacebar                          YY013799
         Spring, Print Key, Clear, Escape          YY012913
         Spring, All Others                        YY012914
         Pad  (foam/foil for each key)             YY006594
         Screws (hold PCBA to Keyboard)            YY019809

3. After cleaning the keyboard and attempting simple repair, if the keyboard is
   still not working properly, return it to Tustin using the normal return
   process.

4. MM810041 (Grey 4312 keyboard) and MM810036 (Putty 4312 keyboard) are
   alternates for each other and should be treated as such. If you need the
   opposite color, take the time to switch the keycaps and enclosure rather
   than ordering another keyboard. (Estimated time of about 10 minutes to
   switch everything).

5. Effective February 1, 1991, the field will not be able to Code A the 4309
   and 4312 keyboards from Tustin (P/N MM783020, MM810036, MM810041).

      *** DT4315 Revision D Firmware, List of changes from Revision C ***

Following is a list of changes that have been implemented since Revision C:
  1. The protocol problem with the BFIS->ISP and BFIS->BFIS modes has been
fixed. This problem happened when the <ETX> code preceding the CRC character in
the BFIS protocol was followed by an <EXT> checksum value. The occurrence is no
w
handled correctly.

  2. The Packet Panic that occurs when a bypass print is performed after a VT
reset, has been fixed.

  3. The Packet Panic that occurs when several VT Resets have been performed,
has been fixed.

  4. The Packet Panic that occurs when many <ESC>B's are sent, has been fixed. 
.
This happens on 13XX quite often.

NOTE: This Revision change available with Market Code KE192AA.

               *** DISABLE PASSWORD SECURITY ON 4315 TERMINAL ***

SYMPTOM/TEXT: Password security has been enabled on a 4315 terminal and the
password is unknown. Without a password the terminal will not operate on a
system and the set-up menu is inaccessible.

FIX:
1. Power terminal off and remove cover.

2. At IC location U6, connect a jumper from pin 5 to ground.

3. Power on terminal, enter set-up menu and disable password security.

4. Power off terminal, remove jumper, and reassemble terminal.

Subject : DT 4315 & 4315A using VT100 emulation with OpenBASIC
Type    : Problem
Symptom : DT 4315 & 4315A using VT100 emulation with OpenBASIC, the
          mmnemonic 'SB' will display the information in Foreground and using
          mmnemonic 'SF' will display information in Background.
Solution: You must modify the terminal setup, In Terminal Management select
          Vitual Terminal Options, Select Configure Selected VT, select VT100
          parameters, select option Bold attribute and change the option from
          Half Intensity  to Compatible and save the change.

Note    : The option for Bold Attributes are not found on DT 4315 & 4315A
          terminals that are on REV A. You must be on REV C or above to set
          this option.
