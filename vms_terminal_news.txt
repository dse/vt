VMS terminal news

Using a terminal under the VMS (OpenVMS)  multiuser operating system,
which was invented by Digital Equipment Corporation, starved by Compaq,
and now slumbering fitfully under Hewlett-Packard.

 = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =

When I was a VMS user, in my own LOGIN.COM, I liked to define the following
symbols so that clearing the screen and setting reasonable default conditions
was easy:

$!  section of LOGIN.COM
$!
$! building-block symbols
$!
$    ESC[0,8] == %x1B      ! Escape
$    CSI[0,8] == %x9B      ! 8-bit equivalent to "ESC ["
$    SS3[0,8] == %x8F      ! 8-bit equivalent to "ESC O"
$  CTRLN[0,8] == %x0E      ! ASCII SO "shift out"
$  CTRLO[0,8] == %x0F      ! ASCII SI "shift in"
$!
$! many local symbols, which will be tacked together into fewer global symbols
$!
$  PRINTOFF = "''ESC'[4i''ESC'[?4i"
$  GRAPHOFF = "''ESC'[?38l''ESC'\"
$   CHARSET = "''ESC'(B''CTRLO'"
$  NORVIDEO = "''ESC'[?5l"
$  REVVIDEO = "''ESC'[?5h"
$  SCRNATTR = "''ESC'[0m"
$ ALLSCROLL = "''ESC'[r"
$   CLRHOME = "''ESC'[H''ESC'[2J"
$      WRAP = "''ESC'[?7h"
$!
$      SAY == "WRITE SYS$OUTPUT"
$!
$!  Yes, you do need all these quotes.
$!
$      cls =="''SAY' ""''PRINTOFF'''GRAPHOFF'''CHARSET'''NORVIDEO'''SCRNATTR'''ALLSCROLL'''CLRHOME'"""
$!
$   clsrev =="''SAY' ""''PRINTOFF'''GRAPHOFF'''CHARSET'''REVVIDEO'''SCRNATTR'''ALLSCROLL'''CLRHOME'"""
$!
$!  the simple way, if that's all you need...
$!
$ clear =="type/page nl:"
$!


Then here are some other useful terminal things for LOGIN.COM


$ if f$mode() .eqs. "INTERACTIVE" then SET TERM/inquire/NOeight
$ if f$mode() .eqs. "INTERACTIVE" then -
                                WRITE SYS$OUTPUT f$getdvi("tt:","tt_accpornam")
$ if f$getdvi("tt:","devtype") .eqs."112" then THIS_TERM == "vt300-7"

(I assume that by "standby mode" you mean you're putting the computer
running PuTTY into a suspend-to-RAM mode where programs aren't running.)

Since PuTTY won't respond to any packets the server sends, and the
server will usually kill the connection if a response isn't forthcoming,
you don't want the server to send anything while the client is idle;
if you can arrange that, you _might_ get away with this (but it's not
guaranteed; the client OS may irretrievably break TCP connections as
part of standby, for instance).

So, no, TCP keepalives (or any other kind of keepalive) will *hinder*
you, not help you. Another thing to watch out for is server-initiated
time-based rekey (in SSH-2).

There is some discussion of these issues in the PuTTY manual, at

    http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-keepalive

>   Does anyone have a VMS TERMTABLE.TXT entry for a WYSE-50 terminal?

     We've got entries for several foreign terminals, but wyse isn't one
of them.  Such entries are generally easy to create, particularly if
you've already got a termcap or terminfo definition.  A program for
automating the conversion has been previously posted; I don't remember
the details though.

     TERMTABLE constitutes a database for the VMS SMG screen management
library, so it's of value for programs which use SMG$ routines or use
VAXCRTL's curses routines (which are layered on top of SMG).  MAIL
and ANU-NEWS are a couple of programs which would take advantage of it.
Neither EDT nor TPU use SMG though, so you're out of luck on that score
(EVE, LSE, and VAXnotes are all TPU programs).

     Does your WYSE have a VT52 emulation mode?  If so, using that should work.

     Yes, you can do that.  You need to set up the logical name called
TERM$TABLOC or something close to that.  It's documented in a section
of the SMG manual.  You compile termtable.txt into termtable.exe using
``$ run sys$system:smgbldtrm'' and set up that logical to point to the
directory containing your alternate termtable.  Then you can use
``$ set terminal/device=wyse50'' to tell VMS what type of terminal
you've got.  You don't need to copy the system-wide termtable into your
private one; the system will search both term$tabloc:termtable.exe and
sys$system:termtable.exe for the device specified.

     If you change the system-wide termtable, you'll need to redo the
change(s) after each VMS upgrade.

 --------------------- --------------------- ---------------------

On several DEC operating systems, including VMS, typing
Control-O activates a command-line toggle that means
"stop sending output to the terminal, but continue processing."

VMS also uses Control-T and Control-Y for a job-status query
and "halt process (restart possible)", respectively.

Control-C also usually stops programs, as in Unix.

I read through the TFF docs, and it seemed to be more of a lookup

do some corrolary to /etc/termcap to make it happen.

    Two points:

        1) You'll want  to  look  in  the  _Run  Time  Library  -  Screen
           Management  (SMG$) Manual_ for information on adding "foreign"
           terminals  (as  Ed  noted).   In  the  VMS  V5.x   docs,   its
           _Programming  Volume  5C_  in  the Grey Wall (I don't have the
           White Wall yet :-)  or,  in  Bookreader, select "VMS Operating
           System"   ->   "OpenVMS  Programming  Reference  and   Utility
           Documents" -> "RTL Screen Management (SMG$)".  Look at Chapter
           5 of either source.                                           

        2) While it  is  true  that  neither  EDT  nor  TPU  use  the SMG
           interface  (much to the distress of many of us), TPU  requires
           _only_  that  the  terminal  support  ANSI   sequences.    Set
           "ansi_crt  =  1"  in your termtable entry for the 5620 and TPU
           (and EDT) will allow you  to  edit.  If the 5620 supports more
           VT characteristics, then specify them and they'll be used.    

           Getting a  reasonable  key  board  mapping  for  the editor is
           another  matter  and  depends  on what  escape  sequences  the
           various keys (I'm thinking function keys and/or numeric keypad
           keys, etc.) send to the host.  Send me mail if you  need  more
           details.

	The MAIL utility filters out escape sequences to prevent people doing 
nasty things to your terminal; things like programming one of the function 
keys to delete all your files.

	If you EXTRACT a mail message to a sequential file and then TYPE that 
file, you will see the blinking, bright, underline, etc.

	VMS, itself, does not use any escape sequences at all.  You can talk 
to it with a "glass teletype" and everything will work just fine.  The screen 
editors: EDT and EVE, and some other utilities use escape sequences for screen
and cursor control.  The editors basically have the VT100 escape sequences 
hard coded.  They are not usable unless you have a DEC VT100 or better.  
(Actually, I *think* you could use a VT52 if you could find one in working 
order).

	Newer software may use the SMG$ (screen management) routines 
which can support "foreign" terminals in addition to the standard DEC 
terminals.

	You can find information on VTxxx escape sequences in ANSI Standard 
X3.64.  DEC actually uses a superset of the ANSI standard with "DEC Private" 
sequences defined according to the ANSI rules for defining such things.  The
sequences are discussed in the "Programmer Reference Manual" for each DEC 
terminal and, sometimes, in a "Programmer Reference Card".

	You can look at (but don't modify) SYS$SYSTEM:SMGTERMS.TXT for the
escape sequence definitions used by Digital terminals.  See "VMS RTL Screen 
Management (SMG$) Manual", order number AA-LA77A-TE (for VMS V5), chapter 5,
"Support for non-Digital Terminals" for more info.

Another Frequently Answered Question :-) 

I might as well chime in with my personal favorites:

1) RTFM: Beg steal or borrow a programmers reference card/booklet
   for an VTxxx terminal. Invaluable!

2) Finding and entering the escape sequence for a giving function
   key is extremely easy in EDT (once you know how :-).

All it takes is to start a bogus escape sequence by just entering a single
Escape ( control-3, or control-[ is my favourite) and then follow that
with the desired key. The leading escape from the function key will now
make EDT terminate that single ESC and output it.
The characters from the sequence now magically turn into straight input. 
ESC - PF1 --->  <ESC>OP

3) SMGTERMS.TXT

Hope this helps,		+--------------------------------------+

        Yes, easy: SET TERM/PAGE=36.   Basically,  you've got to let the
    VMS  _host_  know  how  many  lines it  can  display  on;  it's  not
    sufficient to use the VT420'a local setup.  Once the host knows, TPU
    will work just fine.  Note that a SET TERM/INQUIRE  will  _not_,  in
    and  of  itself,  query  the  VT420 to find out how many _lines_ are
    displayed on the  screen.   [I've  just  recently  been perusing the
    VT420 user's manual and there _are_ some neat things you can tell it
    to  do,  and  ask it to report, but SET TERM/INQ  doesn't  do  those
    things.]  In  the  past,  people  have  posted  various  methods  to
    determine  the  screen length by sending various escape sequences to
    the terminal (some of them  are  pretty  neat  :-), but I think just
    doing  it by hand is not such a big deal...and you can always define
    a symbol $ PAG*E == "SET TERM/PAGE="  if  you  want  to  reduce  the
    typing.  :-)

Think about it.

1)  VMS - TTAn: device - adapter - serial line - terminal

The speed/parity/databits/stopbits can and must be set on both the
adapter and the terminal. The adapter and the TTAn: device is the
hardware and software side of the same thing, so setting s/p/db/sb
on the TTA: device makes sense.

2)  VMS - LTAn: device - ethernetcard - ethernet - DECserver -
    serial line - terminal

The LTAn: devices is NOT connected to a serial line and s/p/db/sb does
not give any meaning. So you cannot use them on a LTAn:. You can set
s/p/db/sp on the terminal server (because it is connected to a serial
line, so it makes sense).

You can do that either from a terminal connected to the terminal-server
or by connecting to the terminal server from VMS (DECnet phase IV:
$ MCR NCP CONN NODE name, DECnet/OSI: $ SET HOST/MOP name).

Why does VMS not do that automatically, when I do my SETMODE ?  Because
there is no question about which VMS systems owns a good old adapter
(it is the VAX that it is physical placed in), but a DECserver can
serve several VMS systems. It is the password on the server that
determine, who can change the setup. It is even worse on a DECserver 90,
where you need to switch is off and on to get privilige.

The control communication with a DECserver is done with a protocol called
MOP. If your program needs to access DECserver ports, then your only
choices are:

  - use the MOP protocol to communicate directly with the DECserver

  - create a psudo-device with the PTY$-routines and use them to
    call DIGITAL's documented interface via DCL commands

Long story (and I may even have got some of the detail wrong), but I hope
you understand the problem better now.

I've seen behavior like this if your terminal's TAB settings have gotten
changed between one execution and the next.  SMG$ seems to assume that
your TABs are set to "every 8th column."  If they're not, you don't get
precisely the display that SMG$ _thinks_ it is generating.  

If you aren't setting your terminal's TABs explicitly, you may be running
some other program in the course of a normal workday, or conversely upon
first logging in in the morning, that is setting them "behind the scenes."
If you're using a real terminal, you can hit SETUP and restore the TABs
to every-8-columns; if you're using an emulator, this may not be avail-
able (DECterm, to my great annoyance, doesn't seem to provide this function),
but there's an escape sequence you can send to the terminal (even DECterms,
thank goodness) to set the TABs you want.  I don't have it memorized so
can't tell you what the sequence is.  Check your terminal's programming
manual, or one of the numerous how-to files available on the Net.

Hope this helps.

Most VT terminals don't let you use the F1-F5 keys as anything but Local
function keys, such as terminal setup mode, etc.  But the VT420 does
allow you to select either this local meaning for the F1-F5 keys or to
allow these keys to send escape sequences for use by the host software
like the rest of the function keys.  Unless you are _sure_ that your
application will never run on anything but a VT420 (or any follow-on
terminals, such as graphics or workstation implementations, not that
they are very likely to be built at this point in history), you should
probably not rely on being able to use the F1-F5 keys;  if the user is
on a VT220 or VT320 (or compatible) then the functions could not be used.

I don't know offhand if SMG completely supports getting at F1-F5 on a
VT420;  I wouldn't be terribly surprised either way.  The appropriate
definitions are in SYS$SYSTEM:SMGTERMS.TXT but I don't know if the
proper terminator codes are returned & I don't have a good way to test
it at the moment (no VT420 handy).  But even if it does you are probably
better off not using them unless you know exactly what hardware the
users have -- there are probably far more VT320's (and compatibles,
including terminal emulators) out there than there are VT420's.

BTW Arne, it loo

	Well, yes and no.  You aren't doing a thing to the VT220.  It's 
sending the same escape sequences it always was.  You are telling DCL to 
place a different *interpretation* on those escape sequences.

	I believe that these definitions are effective *only* at DCL level.
MAIL, EDT and other utilities may allow you to "DEFINE /KEY" and those 
definitions are effective only within that utility.

Well, since he mentions that he doesn't want to use SHOW SYSTEM or SHOW

True, but again, since he seems to've indicated that the information from SHOW

Right.  It sounds as if perhaps what he needs is something like the following:

$	X = F$CONTEXT("PROCESS",CTX,"USERNAME",F$GETJPI("","USERNAME"),"EQL")
$ LOOP:	PID = F$PID(CTX)

$	IF F$EXTRACT(0, 3, TERM) .NES. "FTA" THEN GOTO LOOP
$	N = N + 1
$	GOTO LOOP
$ DONE:	WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "You have ", N, " DECTerms open."

Note:  I haven't tested the above procedure, but I believe it SHOULD return the

        It is, but you need to use the ANSI color escape sequences.  You
    can find these  on  any  VMS  system in SYS$SYSTEM:SMGTERMS.TXT, you
    only  need to know that a dollar-sign, $, is a "meta-character"  for
    escape, 0x1b.  Here are the foreground colors, in SMG-speak:

	black_screen = "$[40m",		blue_screen = "$[44m",
	cyan_screen  = "$[46m",		green_screen = "$[42m",
	magenta_screen = "$[45m",	red_screen  = "$[41m",
	white_screen = "$[47m",		yellow_screen = "$[43m"

    For background, use <esc>[30m --> <esc>[37m in place of the forties.
    Also, use <esc>[39m and  <esc>[49m  to  turn  off the background and
    foreground ANSI colors (i.e., put them back to the defaults).

Hello, Roger.

To answer your immediate question: yes and no.  There are escape sequences
which can do "some" of the things necessary to implement the type of behavior
you want; the easiest thing would be to have your "display" .COM procedure
position the terminal cursor to a predefined location, then "paint" a 4-
column by 2-line region with the data you want.  In order to prevent your
"main" process from interrupting with ITS data, you should format everything
you want output, into ONE long string, then emit it with a single WRITE
SYS$OUTPUT statement.

Try something like this:

$ ESC[0,8] = 27
$!
$!  Define region's size in columns and lines
$ N_COLS = 4
$ N_LINES= 2
$!
$!  Define region's upper-left corner position
$ UL_X = 10
$ UL_Y = 15
$!
$!  File-opening probably happens here; maybe data-acquisition also
$!
$ LINE = 0 
$ REPORT = ""
$ LOOP:
$ FORMAT = F$FAO("!!#<!AS[!UB;!UBH!!AS!!>",ESC,UL_Y+LINE,UL_X)
$!
$!   "STRING_DATA" is a string containing the next line of data to output.
$!    This loop should contain the necessary code to update "STRING_DATA"
$!    _before_ executing the BUFFER = F$FAO(...) statement which follows.
$!
$ STRING_DATA = F$CVTIME(,,"HUNDREDTH") 
$!
$ BUFFER = F$FAO(FORMAT, (N_COLS + F$LEN(FORMAT) - 5), STRING_DATA) 
$ REPORT = REPORT + BUFFER
$ LINE = LINE + 1
$ IF (LINE .LT. N_LINES) THEN $ GOTO LOOP
$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT REPORT
$!
$!  Any cleanup goes here
$!
$ EXIT

Good luck.

        There's DSNlink article in  the  OpenVMS database which appeared
    this  morning  titled,  "Printing ASCII Escape  Sequences  Gives  LF
    Instead of CRLF".  It describes the problem you're  seeing,  applies
    to  both Alpha and VAX VMS 6.2, and suggests either you "contact the

And some are. Reminds me of my favorite Bill Hancock story. He was manning 
the help desk one day, and the phone rang :

Bill : "Hello, Help Desk"
User : (Gruffly) "Cursor's broke!"
Bill : "Beg your pardon?"
User : "Cursor's broke on my VT220 computer."
Bill : "Um, a VT220 is a terminal, not a computer, it's..."
User : "It *SAYS* VT220 right on the front!"
Bill : "OK, whatever. What's the problem?"
User : "There's no cursor on the screen"
Bill : "Are you sure it's plugged in?"
User : "Of course I'm sure. What do you think I am, some kind of idiot?"

Bill : (Using all the restraint he can muster) No, of course not. OK, here's
       what I want you to do. Sometimes the polarity gets reversed on those
       VT220 computers. So, I want you to unplug it from the outlet, turn
       the plug around, and plug it back in" (knowing full well that it's a
       grounded plug and can only be plugged in one way, of course)

User : "OK, let me put the phone down". (Klunk. Step, step, step, step as
       he walks across the room. Silence. Then a faraway-sounding, whiny
       "b-e-e-e-e-p". Step, step, step, step). "OK, polarity reversed and
       the VT220 computer's working fine now!


Technical content follows :

Use SET TERMINAL/SYSPASSWORD/PERM. If a system password has not
previously been set, use SET PASSWORD/SYSTEM to set it. Note that this
does not really answer the question as asked, which was to prevent *all*
users from accessing the terminal. If *no one* is to be able to access it,
then the solution is to remove the power supply.

Can't you use the psydo-terminal utility to remap the keypad? The LOGGER
utility puts you into a subprocess, takes the keyboard data, journals it
and then passes it on - couldn't it remap the keys before passing the data
on? (Maybe the Lib$Translate routines could be passed a table of values
so conversion could be handled by provided routines?)

Followup.  Thought I would test the com file above on a VT320, and
guess what.  Only keys F16-F20 display.  So the com file can't be used
to test to see if F11 and F12 are working.

But the question still remains.  How do you get F11 and F12 to work in
K95 just like it does on a real VT320?

We have just replaced CA's (Digital's) Polycenter Console Manager by KI's

All UNIX variants support 4000 to 5000 terminal types out of the box.  The
DEC series of terminals was the most prevalent at the universities where
BSD UNIX was developed, and so support for the VT320 in BSD goes back to
when the VT320 first came out.  In fact, ~95% of software never takes
advantage of the VT320 capabilities that are above VT220 capabilities,
and so setting your UNIX TERM environment variable to VT220 will accomplish
most all of the same thing.

> AFAIK, the termcap/terminfo stuff is unix generic, not just Linux...
> so it'd be better than VMS if I plan to use the VS3100 in a network...

VT320's were supported in VMS even better than in UNIX.  For example, EDT
and LSE in EDT mode took better advantage of the 20-some-odd function
keys and the numeric keypad in "application" and "function" modes than
they did of a VT220.

(for those lurkers out there, EDT is a WordStar-like visual editor that
 navigated mostly through the numeric keypad in its two modes -- and used
 to ship with a keyboard overlay to remember what key was what in each of
 several shift states)

Also, DEC's All-In-One office productivity software took advantage of the
VT320's capabilities (or the VT320 in "VT300" mode) over a VT220's
capabilities.  And DEC's IBM 3250 terminal emulation took advantage of the
VT320 over the VT220 when available.

VMS was the most popular operating system shipped for manufacturing, and
the VT320 terminal was the most used by those applications.  So you'll
find Order Entry, Forecasting, Production Line Operation & Control and
similar applications taking advantage of the extended character sets and
multiple scroll regions and other VT320-specific capabilities more so on
VMS systems than anywhere else.

Remember what I said before -- it is not the operating system that supports
a terminal type, but rather the applications in the operating system.  DEC
applications under VMS supported more of the extended capabilities in the
VT320 over its own VT220 than you'll find applications in UNIX supporting
the extended capabilities of the VT320 over the VT220.  UNIX however has
built-in libraries and services to allow an application to be written for a
general terminal, and the user's terminal type can be modified on the fly
and the application will be able to take advantage of it -- on the fly.

Uh?!?  DecNet has nothing to do with terminal emulation or capabilities.

I'm not sure what you mean by the "end" key.  There is no key on a Sun
keyboard with this label, nor is it a key on any DEC keyboard that I
recall.   [...but see below]

The "telnet" command of a Solaris system does *not* provide terminal
emulation; you get the terminal emulation of whichever environment you
are running in; telnet just connects you to the remote machine.

The usual thing in Solaris 7 would be that you are using the X Windows
CDE environment, where you've got a choice of "dtterm", "cmdtool", or
good old "xterm"--three separate programs that provide terminal
emulation, all slightly different.  And the type of terminal emulation
that you get is *not* influenced by the setting of the TERM
environment variable.  (TERM is for the benefit of the other end of
the connection, the computer you telnet *to*.)

Probably you are using dtterm; it is supposed to emulate a VT220 type.
But the keys of a VT220 differ from a Sun keyboard, so you may need
to remap your keyboard in that program to achieve the effect you want.
The classic "xterm" program emulates a VT102.

The VT420 provides a superset of the capabilities of a VT220; it is
extremely rare to encounter a case where you need a feature implemented
in the VT420 but not in the VT220.  

Some collected information on this and other video terminals may be
found at:

    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html

You should look to the "xterm" page and see several links about
xterm and dtterm, perhaps the one about "OSF/Motif xterm", which I
think discusses a key mapping suitable for telnetting to a VMS host.

There are also discussions about DEC terminals and about using
terminals with Unix.

He is correct.  In glancing quickly at the Sun Type 5 keyboard that
sits at my right elbow, I overlooked the "End" key--but there it is,
right between "Del" and "Page Down".

This reminds me of the general problem:  In terminal emulation, there
is often a design conundrum:  do you re-assign function keys according
to how they are labeled, or  according to their position on the
keyboard?  Sometimes you need to maintain the position of the key on
the keyboard that you are emulating; other times maybe you want to
match the label as closely as possible.

The editing bank of function keys on the Sun keyboards is pretty
close to those on a 102- or 104-key PC keyboard:

  +-------------+-------------+-------------+
  |             |             |             |
  | Insert      | Home        | Page-Up     |
  |             |             |             |
  +-------------+-------------+-------------+
  |             |             |             |
  | Delete      | End         | Page-Down   | 
  |             |             |             |
  +-------------+-------------+-------------+

..but the DEC LK201 has its own editing-key arrangement:

  +-------------+-------------+-------------+
  |             |             |             |
  | Find        | Insert-Here | Remove      |
  |             |             |             |
  +-------------+-------------+-------------+
  |             |             |             |
  | Select      | Prev-Screen | Next-Screen |
  |             |             |             |
  +-------------+-------------+-------------+

..and you can see that the meanings don't correspond by position.

So, you might find it set up either way, depending on which emulation
you are running (or in the X Windows CDE dtterm/xterm case, on settings
in ~/.Xresources and  ~/.Xdefaults).

and Jeff Altman astutely noted:

) [...] the VMS [application] should query for the keyboard type via
) a control sequence and not make assumptions based upon the terminal
) type string provided by telnet.

Scott:
  
On my website [here], the DEC-terminals page has a link called
"Notes on DEC VT220, VT3x0, VT420, etc., special/advanced codes"
which retrieves the file "dec_vt220_codes.txt"

In this file is a message from Jerry Leichter, who reveals that the
TDSMP (Terminal Device Session Management Protocol) is covered by
two US patents, 4791566 and 5165020.  Presumably Boundless now owns   
the rights.
