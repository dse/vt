<A HREF = "http://www.vineinternational.org/"
>Vine International</A>
is a low-overhead organization that specializes in
providing assistance to rural medical clinics in Central America.  I'm
personally acquainted with the operation, and I've seen that the staff
and volunteers of Vine will risk their necks to transport medical
supplies and equipment, including wheelchairs, to recipients that
really need it.</P>

<P>
Vine collects surplus medicine and supplies from hospitals and vendors
in North America and takes it where it is most needed.  Vine works in
concert with other organizations, notably Samaritan's Purse in the US
and Hospital Shalom in Mazatenango, Guatemala.  With respect to the
tax code in the United States,  Vine International is a 501(c)3 nonprofit
charity.</P>

<P>
In November 1995, Vine volunteers loaded a schoolbus with medicines,
hospital equipment, and wheelchairs, and then drove it from Tennessee
to Guatemala. (The chairs were donated by Wheels for the World, the
organization founded by Joni Earickson Tada).</P>

When the load arrived in Guatemala, the recipients of wheelchairs
included the five children of the Lopez family. Standing are (L to R)
David Richard, the three Lopez adults, Vine Director Woody Woodson
(with his son Gabe), and Mark Richard.
