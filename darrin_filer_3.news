Subject: WYSE150   v.   ASCII line graphics

I can't seem to get any line graphics to display on a WYSE150es. (The
upper 128 through 255 ascii characters) We're running it in vt100 mode
off of Red Hat Linux 6.2.

Using the Anita terminal emulation program in Windows, I've gotten the
line graphics to display by setting the character set to "IBM PC
(OEM)". However, we still have terminals in use so I need to get them
to display the characters properly as well. Since the characters are
displayed properly in the emulator, I'm assuming that they are being
transmitted properly and all I need to do is find the appropriate
setting for the WYSE150 in vt100 mode.

This probably has something to do with character set selection, but
all the limited doumentation I've found on the web has got me no
where...

This could depend on the fidelity of the Wyse terminal's VT100 emulation. A 
real VT100 only accepts 7-bit characters (ie. it'll just ignore the top 
bit).

Subject: tuxedo.org's terminfo - no destructive backspace for WYSE50 or
    WYSE150 ?

We've got a WYSE 150es which needs to display ascii line graphics.
Instead of bashing my head against the vt100 workarouds for this,
we've decided to run the terminal in its native personality, wyse 150
or 150+. Unfortunately, the backspace key isn't functioning properly,
behaving simply as a left arrow. control-b does the same thing as
control-h or the left arrow key.

In fact, I haven't found a control sequence for a WYSE 150 that
actually does do a destructive backspace. I'm becoming more familiar
with the terminfo file but even the one found at tuxedo.org doesn't
have a functional backspace.

With the terminal set to emulate WYSE 150 or 150+ (actually the native
personality) and TERM=wy150  --- screen attributes like reverse video
don't work
With the terminal set to emulate WYSE 50 or 50+ and TERM=wy50 or wy150
-- line graphics come out as other characters
With the terminal set to emulate WYSE 150 or 150+ and TERM=wy50 --
screen attributes are ok!

All three of these scenarios fail to produce a destructive backspace.
However, running as a WYSE150+ with TERM=wy50 at least gets me the
line art and correct text display attributes. The other choice is to
run as a vt100 with TERM=vt100 and use no line graphics but with a
destructive backspace.

Does anyone out there have a destructive backspace on their WYSE150
with TERM=wy50 or wy150 or ?????

Unfortunately you don't say to what kind of system this Wyse 150-es
is attached, or what type of software application is communicating
with the terminal.
 
Putting on my Sherlock Holmes Detective Hat, I deduce from your
reference to a "terminfo" file that the host system has terminal
control of the type associated with System V Unix derivatives.

It would be a mild extrapolation to deduce that you have not read
the documentation for the "stty" command, as by typing "man stty".
Depending on the Unix flavor, other man pages of significance
might be ldterm, termio, and termios (as in the case of Solaris;
for other Unix implementations or for Linux, your mileage may vary).

Now, admittedly, man-page documentation is often useful only if you
already have an idea of what to look for.  If you'd like a kinder,
gentler introduction to the subject, I suggest you look here first:
    
    http://www.aplawrence.com/Unixart/terminals.html

and then follow up with resources listed at:
    
    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html

Although not must use with most System V Unix products, the
following is useful for those with BSD-derived Unix systems:

A real VT100 does NOT do codepage 437.

In VT100 mode the Wy120 (the previous model) strips off the top bit ie it
ignores parity. In fact the wy120's emulation is so good that it even gets
the finer differences between the vt100 and the vt220 correct eg: NRC mode.

I don't think you will be able to do this in vt100 mode. If you're in
vt220 mode (assuming the wy150 has it) you can set the high bit characters
to ISO-8859-1 (or latin1) which is the character set that Windows cp1252
is based on. This way you'll have a for more standard high bit character
set for £ and αινσϊ.

You can still access the real line drawing characters (the box corners
etc) by using the VT100 character set controls (if 'Anita' is any good
at all) by making sure that the TERM variable in Linux is vt100, vt220
or something similar.

If you get this right your next headache is function keys -- a real vt100
has _none_ ... though it does have four 'PF' keys.

If you can't access the characters you want in vt100 mode may have more
luck in native mode, but make sure the host knows it's talking to a wy150
not a vtklone. (TERM= variable) The wyse website has some documentation
on the terminals if you need to go past the basic terminfo.

BTW:
  I use ISO-8859-1 on all of wy120, Linux console, xterm and Windows
  terminal emulators (PuTTY, CRT etc). The wyse works fine (including
  boxes) in vt220 mode with a stock vt220 terminfo but the f-keys are
  mis-labeled so I use this instead:

vt220-120|Wyse120 in VT220 emulation mode,
      kf1=\EOP, kf2=\EOQ, kf3=\EOR, kf4=\EOS,                                         kf5=\E[M, kf6=\E[17~, kf7=\E[18~, kf8=\E[19~,
      kf9=\E[20~, kf10=\E[21~, kf11=\E[23~, kf12=\E[24~,

This is the main reason I don't like wyse native modes. The left arrow and
backspace both default to ^H. The normal workaround is to map one or the
other to some other sequence in the terminal then adjust the terminfo to
match. As down arrow (which is mapped to ^J) is also frequently a problem
I tended to remap the arrow keys. Once the arrow keys are out of the way

  stty erase ^H

will make the backspace destructive. Just to complete the problem the
function keys are also a little weird and occasionally give problems
as their sequences include ^A (which may get eaten) and ^M (which may
be translated to ^J)!

true (the reference to 128-255 sounds more like an emulator running on a PC)

hmm - just looking at it, I don't see which is mislabeled.  (Is your
base 'vt220' numbering the keys off-by-one?)

Subject: Re: tuxedo.org's terminfo - no destructive backspace for WYSE50 or
    WYSE150 ?

Ok, getting closer. Thanks for the assistance.

I've used the setup screen on the WYSE150 to remap the left arrow key
to control-B. Pressing the left arrow key now produces ^B on the
screen. This can be deleted as a single character by pressing the
backspace key. Obviously the desired behavior is moving the cursor one
character to the left.

I assumed this behavior could be set in terminfo with the following
syntax:
kcub1=^B,
or (what's the diffence between these anyway)
cub1=^B,
However, hitting a control-B or the left arrow, which produces this
sequence, only puts ^B on the screen. The terminfo settings were
verified after running tic by looking at the output of infocmp and
they were in fact set. Next I tried typing: stty erase ^B to see what
would happen. Yet control-B still only displays ^B.

What am I missing?
(I've pasted the output from infocmp below)

These are the function keys in my vt220 terminfo.

   kf1=\EOP, kf2=\EOQ, kf3=\EOR, kf4=\EOS, kf5=\E[17~,
   kf6=\E[18~, kf7=\E[19~, kf8=\E[20~, kf9=\E[21~, kf10=\E[29~,

Hmmm, looking at the master it looks like I've got the 'vt220-old' version,
I still need to do the same with the new one though 'cause of F5.

man 5 terminfo

      key_backspace             kbs    kb   backspace key
      key_left                  kcub1  kl   left-arrow key
      cursor_left               cub1   le   move left one space

The ones that begin with 'k' are for the sequences sent by keys.
The ones without are sent by the application to move the cursor round the
screen, don't change these.

Make sure your compiled terminfo is actually used by your application
(eg: get rid of the standard one in /usr/share/terminfo/w while testing)

Note, command line utilities (cat!) don't normally use terminfo however
any that have been linked with the readline utility (eg: bash) will if
/etc/inputrc or ~/.inputrc have been setup (man readline).

If you're using readline (bash) you may want to setup the keys in 'emacs'
mode 'cause readline doesn't always obey terminfo properly:

In terminfo
   kcub1=^B, kcuf1=^F, kcuu1=^P, kcud1=^N,

and in bash
  set -o emacs

or in inputrc
  set editing-mode emacs

This is what you get it you are using bash in 'vi' mode, bash thinks it
knows best, other programs know better.
