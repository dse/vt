The Microsoft Windows "Terminal Server" is not the same thing as
a classical "terminal server" for serial character-cell terminals.

The Microsoft product is server software for a proprietary thin-client
display protocol.

Companies such as Citrix, Wyse, and Bryant Computers*  make products
that use this Windows Terminal Server facility to connect to Windows
NT/2000/XP servers.

No, this cannot be done in the method you are referring to.

The only way would be by using third party software, or even 
Microsoft Netmeeting (properly configured to autoanswer).

What model is the winterm? It will help. I've setup thousands of winterms.

Subject: Microsoft's VTNT

Has anyone put together a public description of the "VTNT" terminal
type used by Microsoft's recent telnet client and their Services for
Unix telnet server?

I understand Kermit95 supports it, but source isn't available (as far
as I can remember, or find now), and C-Kermit knows just enough about
it to know that it doesn't support it.

As a side note, any opinions on whether it is compliant with the
telnet RFCs?  I have a telnet server with rudimentary support TTYPE
support, and wasn't expecting changes quite as drastic as VTNT causes.

There is no public description of the terminal definition.  In fact, the 
definition is not consistent across separate releases of the telnet
service.

C-Kermit does not support any terminal definitions.

Kermit 95 does support several variants of VTNT but the terminal 
emulation code is not public.

   Bryant Technologies was suspended by the JSE between February last
   year and January this year due to allegations of misstated accounts
   and irregular share dealings that led to the resignation of the entire
   board of directors. The company admitted that sales had been
   overstated, the 1999 results were restated and two directors paid
   fines to the Financial Service Board's insider trading directorate.
   The JSE reinstated the stock for trade after it released results for
   the year to June 2000 in January. The new board said at the time this
   year's numbers would show losses again, but with improvements coming
   through in the second half part of the year.

   Bryant's flagship product, the Sunnix thin client terminal, ran into
   numerous technical problems when first launched and last year's
   numbers contained an audit qualification that its ability to continue
   as a going concern was "dependent upon the company being successful in
   its product repositioning and market acceptance of the product being
   sufficient to restore profitable trading". The share was suspended at
   9c and since being reinstated, has dropped further down the penny
   stock ranks to the current level of 1c, where it has remained since
   the middle of June.

Microsoft's Telnet service, assuming it even runs on Windows 98 is of 
very limited utility. As a telnet service it is incomplete and add to 
that the fact that a bare bones Windows 9x system doesn't provide much 
utility at the comand line

At least nothing I would want to leverage.

Windows 98 is architectually different than Windows NT/2000/XP so 
various useful console-based utilities that provide system information, 
e.g., the PsTools suite from systernals.com, have little or no context there.

A better bet would be to use VNC:

    http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/

VNC gives you a remote view of your GUI desktop. It's like sitting there 
from afar.

This should be no problem for IBM 4695-xxx, although it's a touch
screen. There may also be some issues with graphics displaying higher
than 16 colors.
