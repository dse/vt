I used to use X6530 in a SunOS environment. Yes, you have to spend 
a little time creating a keymap you can live with, but I *really* liked 
the emulator.

Since it's X, you can run multiple copies on 1 machine and have the
display go to complete different workstations (I think this helped
keep our cost down since we only bought one copy). I seem to recall a
feature called Virtual Terminal Launch, where you could specify the
WINDOW option on the TACL command line to spawn programs (e.g. FUP) in
their own X window with their own X resources. Never actually used VTL
though, due to a TACL version mismatch.

Have used x6530 with UnixWare in the Intel platfrom.  I really liked
it.  Then I gave it to the Network Command Center who used Sun. (They
wanted access to our Tandem also)   We got it to run but there was a
problem (or missing) keyboard mapping to the Sun keyboards.  I turned
it over to the guy in the NCC.  He knew Sun (Unix), I know Tandem.

But I can say it does work and it was really useful with my 3-button
mouse.  Had this ability to launch programs like Peruse, Spoolcom, or
whatever with the right mouse button and throw the new process in a
new x window.  There was also this ability to run TEDIT with something
like 48  x 132, but I never had the time to figure it out.  (Didn't
seem to work as advertised) This would have been very useful.

I had heard Tandem turned over support/devel to 2 firms because there
were too may flavors of UNIX.  Tandem had SCO, an Intel (like UnixWare
from Novell at the time), SUN and one other (four flavors of Unix were
listed at the time when I was at MasterCard - where I played with
this).  I think it was D20. Ran fast too.  All over tcp/ip of course.
Had great potential - I thought.

Please post if you get it running/buy it/use it and let us know about
your experience with it/
I think it is called Y9277D20 from 941115 X6530 - TERMINAL EMULATION
UNDER X-WINDOW in the D32 Tandem Software Catalog listing.  It is an
optional product. $

Actually, it is.

This sounds like it could be a cabling problem -- especially if you're
using the cable that came with the terminal. These terminals were
typically connected with a current-loop interface, not the EIA
(RS-232) interface used by PCs. If you got the cable the same place
you got the terminal, you may very well have a current-loop cable,
and that won't work on a PC.

Modem cables won't work either.

What you need is a null-modem cable, one which reverses certain
signal connections (ReceiveData of one device connects to TransmitData
of the other, and so forth).

Are you connecting to a 9-pin or 25-pin serial port on the PC?

Not so.  The 6526 was meant for use with two different TANDEM systems.
The Guardian 90 systems VLX, CLX and Cyclone at that time, and a UNIX
system called LXN.

When used with the LXN, you set the 6526 to ANSI mode (I think it was
ANSI mode, anyway).  You did this through the the terminal
configuration screen.  I believe if you set the 6526 to ANSI mode, it
would work just fine as a dumb terminal on a UNIX server.
 
The port to use is the one marked CPU, and you will need a serial
cross-over cable since, you will be connecting two DTE pieces of
equipment.
 
Good luck!

I really hate pushing Win6530 all the time.  I am starting to feel like a
salesperson :-(  but Win6530 should meet your requirements - except for
launching a window on the PC from NSK.  That is a really nice feature that
seems to be unique to the X environment.  Of course you could always run an X
windows emulator on the PC.  You can download a trial of Win6530 anonymously

Internally, Tandem uses OutsideView (for Windows) to emulate Tandem
Terminals.  I don't know if this is a proprietary implementation, or if it
is available from OutsideView.

You just use the 6530 sequences for Underlined, Dim, Bright, etc. and
set the colors in your terminal emulator to be whichever colors you
want to display  (i.e. set Underlined Dim to RED and whenever
Underlined Dim appears in your application--it will show up as 'Red'
or whatever color the person has selected).  

The only Tandem emulator that I know of that ever did a full range of
colors and graphics is the 'Interm' emulator (Originally by
Transcommunication Corp--bought out by Tandem Computers).  The Interm
emulator is no longer (sigh) available--though it is used extensively
by Mobil Oil specifically for the extended color set (to show
different refined petroleum products in the pipeline).

Hope this helps!

Still need more info on this.  Tandem support is slow to respond to this.  I
will not give up though!

Basically, as of Firmware Revision 'G' in the 653x terminals and emulaters,
new Escape and Control sequences were implmented.  I know of a new 'Esc -'
(hyphen) sequence w/subcodes of 'a-z' (guessing) (i.e., 'Esc -s' and
'Esc -j' are issued by Tandem products) and FS (0x1C) is used to define
fields by Pathway using pre-defined attributes stored in the
terminal/emulator (fixed and variable tables are available).

Anybody have full documentation on this stuff?  Please share with me (us) if
you do or know who might have some.  I know the emulator people must
otherwise there products would not be able to support Rev 'G' or greater.
Thanks,

Brad I used the Esc - sequences a few years back when I was coding TAL block
mode front ends.  It let me select colors and attributes but I found that
the sequences were only supported by the old PCT emulator.  Outside View and
WIN6530 did not handle the sequences correctly, which makes since because
Tandem never made their use public.

May take me a few days to find some time but I'll try and dig up what I have
left.

I do know that current Tandem apps (D-series) use these new sequences (e.g.,
Pathway, TEDIT, others).

And all current emulators seem to also (e.g., OV 5.x, Win6530, ...).  These
Tandem apps query the terminal (using Esc ? and get the firmware rev...if
'G' or greater they send different sequences to the terminal).

I'd appreciate anything you can dig up.

      We have a coporate license for WIN6530.  We switched from the 
old Tandem 6530 terminals to WIN6530 several years ago.  It's working
great.  We have started to use the 32-bit version.  The only issue is
that we don't seem to be able to get the USA who was the original
company who sold us the product to send us the current WIN6530
manual.  I checked with them at last year's ITUG and was told that
the German version was being translated to English and not yet
available.  I should check with ACI who acruired  either the product
or the company.  However, an old user of WIN6530 should not have
trouble with the new versions of the product even without a manual. 
It is that simple to use (In my opinion).  

  An issue we have is that products like WIN6530 take away the ability
to accurately track where is the PC that had logged on to the Tandem
(for Tacl or Pathway session) because IP addresses are not physically
tied to a PC like the PTP 6530 terminals.  One can get close to a
group of PCs at a location, but not necessarily a specific PC.  Audit
does not like this because they feel that if someone was trying to
access the Tandem on a PC in an unauthorized manner, we cannot
determine exactly where was the PC that was used.  Tandem had
committed to implement an enhancement to log to EMS log  connect and
disconnect messages per logon session.  That is a step in the right
direction (this still does not solve the above problem completely),
but there is no reporting capability - there is a lot of other info
in the EMS log.  Perhaps, a third party vendor will find this as an
opportunity to create a reporting product.  Perhaps others have
comments on this matter.  Thanks

It's a 3.2 Meg file.  Once I finally dowloaded it I installed it and
it seems to be working fine. I'm still testing with it, but we are
having all sorts of ideas pop up on how to use this new tool.

Great work Tektonic and keep the good work flowing.

Tandem just announced a new hardware product AWAN which provides a
number of features:

    - remote access (RAS dial-in from Win95, Win/NT,, Novell, etc)
    - async support for 6530 (needed for S-Series)
    - emulation of 6530 on VT100 terminals and emulators

This last feature allows virtually any workstation with a Telnet client
(such as Windows 3.1/95/NT, Unix, Mac) to access host 6530 applications
without any application changes or any host overhead.

The Tandem product data sheet is at:

The press release is at

Fair warning:  Gemini Communications provided the 6530 and VT100
software for this product.

I would recommend that you also have a close look at CAIL's CTT.  In
competes well with Crystal Point's Outside View.  It has Multiple
sessions over a dialup asynchronous connections as well as a HLLAPI
interface, both things that Outside View does not have.  Also, if you
are going to the Windows '95 version, then mapping F16 and SF16 becomes
an issue.  Neither emulator allows ALT-F6 to be used, but CAIL at least
allows CTRL-F6.

Usually when you click on the X icon in Windows95 inside a DOS program such
as PCT then you get a "Windows cannot shut down this program automatically"
message. Are you getting this ? You can only dismiss a DOS session in the
way you describe cleanly by clicking on the X icon once you are back at the
command line.

The simple answer is not to click on the X icon and to CTRL+END :-)

There is no such freeware or shareware.
 
Computer-using institutions who would buy a Tandem system typically have
lots of money. Their managers generally, by policy, will allow use of
only supported commercial products, be it a Unix operating system or a
terminal emulator. So, for them, a shareware terminal emulator under
freeware Linux is an answer to the wrong question. 
 
(Somebody has to pay for those Tandem salesmen, who historically have
been the highest paid salepeople of any company in the entire computer
industry...)
 
The most likely Linux solution would be the Java emulation applet
"J6530 Server" from Tektonic Software (a Tandem subsidiary):
 
    http://www.tektonic.com/
 
Otherwise, a lot of shops seem to buy CrystalPoint's OutsideView:
 
    http://www.outside.com/default.htm
 
Teemtalk is also a decent product:
 
    http://www.pericom.co.uk/
 
Here's an idea: have the institution trade in the Tandem for a
Stratus machine.  Then it (and you) can use a VT320 emulation.  :-)

Sorry, Otto, unless something happened to them in the last couple of
days, Crystal Point is alive and well and still marketing and supporting
Outside View.  They are at +1 206/487-3656 or <sales@outside.com>.

I recommend anyone using or considering purchasing the OutsideView software
from Crystal Point to look at other vendors.  This company is at risk from
several standpoints, listed below.

Management: Last November, Crystal Point fired the director of sales and
marketing.  He was not replaced.  Not long after the engineering manager was
pushed out the door.  He was not replaced either.  Now management consists of a
contractor engineering manager and a contractor project manager (both
essentially part time).  The CEO herself is managing the sales department with
the help of the finance manager.  The finance manager is also running
operations and human resources (personnel).  Does this sound like a
well-managed company to you?

Product: Last fall at ITUG, Crystal Point had a flashy new booth and heavily
promoted a new web browser based solution they called OutsideView Server.  They
had no product to show but ran a nice piece of demoware (built specifically for
ITUG) as a proof of concept.  Internally this product was supposed to be the
future direction of the company.  In January the project was killed.  The new
direction was supposed to be a new version of OutsideView internally known as
"6.0".  Since CP hadn't put out any new products in a while they knew they
needed to do something.  The plans called for keeping the same core product
that is now 5.1 but only adding a flashy new user interface and some minor
customer requests.  They didn't want to tamper with the core code they had
finally gotten working.  Now 6 months later, they have yet to finish the
specifications for 6.0 or even decide on a name for the product (a finished
mailing was yanked at the last minute promoting a product called OutsideView
2000).  So don't expect any tangible products at ITUG this year either.

People: The loss of a major executive and the well-liked engineering manager
was not lost on the employees.  Over half the company has quit (they are down
to about 18 regular full time people from a high of around 36).  The only
position that has been refilled, the only one, was a salesperson.  No
engineers.  Sounds like "sell sell sell" but not "build build build".

CEO: Chris Stephens (pronounced STEFF-ens) is a unique woman.  She says she
built the company out of nothing, but more likely she was in the right place at
the right time.  Her husband and company co-founder Fred developed a terminal
emulator.  Tandem computers came to them with an exclusive offer to sell the
product.  Hard to beat that kind of backing. It was a contentious partnership. 
The nickname for Chris around Tandem was (and probably still is) "The Dragon
Lady".  Her temper is well-known. But she runs a multimillion dollar company. 
Not bad for a high school dropout with no formal business training.  And it
shows.  She treats people like cattle, which probably explains the quick exodus
of highly-skilled engineers and others.  And probably also explains why only 6
employees have been with the company more than two years.

Co-founder: Fred Stephens was the computer whiz whose product made Crystal
Point.  He also has "left" the company to "pursue other directions".  Whatever
the real reason, the co-founder and technical visionary of OutsideView is no
longer with the company.

The Company: Every employee who has ever left Crystal Point has left in anger. 
Perhaps that explains the legal trouble the company faces.  A sexual
harrassment lawsuit was settled out of court.  A wrongful termination lawsuit
has been filed by the former sales and marketing executive. Many others could
do the same thing if they wish.  Two employees, for example, were terminated
under circumstances of blatant age discrimination.  Also the company is being
investigated by the IRS (the USA's tax revenue agency) for its shady monetary
dealings.  (Allegedly, the company has been billed for things such as wedding
showers, private dinners, even redecorating the Stephens' house.)

Profitability: In response to a rumor in PC Week in January, the CEO said the
company's revenue was up 22% over last year.  And the company was above
projections for the fiscal year.  Yet at the end of the fiscal year, the CEO
reports that the company conveniently "broke even" due to "several one-time
extraordinary expenses" and therefore no profit-sharing bonuses would be paid. 
Were there really expenses or were too many ex-employees vested under the
company's 401(k) retirement plan and would have been due their profit share?

In short, this is a company that is spiralling towards disappearance.  You
should not buy any more product from them, or you might find yourself with no
one to support it.

I've gotten a lot emails asking if the negative post on Crystal Point is true. 
It's good to be skeptical.  I can tell you this information comes from several
ex-employees and is very reliable.

They have reasons to be mad.  These are professionals.  Many worked nights and
weekends for months to meet deadlines.  It's only normal to take it personally
when your profit sharing has suspisciously disappeared.  The CEO is a
multimillionaire who earned her money from others' hard work.  Taking this info
public exposes her lack of morals and ethics.

There is also a large installed base of OutsideView.  If Crystal Point
disappears, it impacts a lot of companies (and you) out there.

CP will try to put a positive spin on this info.  When you hear it, realize it
for what it is.  Don't fault the remaining employees for trying to do their
jobs.  Just don't buy any more product.

June 10, 1998

Dear OutsideView User:

Several months ago, Crystal Point underwent an extensive reorganization
in an effort to upgrade our management team and rebuild expertise in key
areas to take the company to the next level. In the aftermath, there has
been false and malicious gossip circulated about our company and
management. We are dismayed and saddened that certain individuals have
seen fit to respond negatively to our positive steps.

Crystal Point is committed to delivering excellent products and services
to our customers, and to providing a constructive, positive working
environment for all our employees.

I want to take this opportunity to share with you some exciting
specifics on our progress and call a couple of important initiatives to
your attention.

First, our product research and development efforts have been
reinvigorated with the addition of Mr. David Gilman. Mr. Gilman is
former Director of Product Development at Attachmate, and an 8-year
Microsoft veteran in technical management and system development
positions. We have high confidence in Mr. Gilman's significant technical
vision and experience. He continues the legacy of Crystal Point
co-founder, Fred Stephens, who is now devoting his energy to another new
business opportunity, and remains involved in the company as a trusted
advisor on technical and sales issues.

Second, Version 6.0 of our 32-bit OutsideView software product is
scheduled for release this fall. While we continue to develop an
appropriate product name, our engineers diligently work to support its
1998 release. As stated some months ago, the development of Outside View
Server has been suspended pending further research and a clearer
efinition of user requirements. Most features intended for the Server
are now being incorporated into Outside View 6.0. These include:

   * over-the-network installations and maintenance updates;
   * data encryption for TCP/IP networks;
   * more flexibility for interface customization; and
   * more administrative controls to prevent unauthorized changes.

Third, Marketing and Sales is now under my direction and we have
strengthened our team with a senior project manager and two marketing
experts to support our extensive market research initiative. We have
undertaken this initiative to assess the new and emerging needs of our
customers, so that we can continue to provide market-leading
connectivity products as Tandem technology and industry evolve.
Thank you for your continued support of our company. If you have any
questions, please feel free to contact us. We welcome your feedback and
inquiries.

Sincerely,

Chris Stephens
Chief Executive Officer

Hi Jeffery,

I am a technical support person from the company Crystal Point ( the
European office ) and we have a document how to setup your system to
be able to use X.25 toghether with OV 5.1. I'll send the document to
your email address, just let me know if it works for you

You should be able to use the Key Mapper in the Options menu to un-map that
key.  Look at the "End of (Line/Field)" function.

That may be. OV 5.0, however, is extremely unstable. We have observed
repeated GPFs and "hung" PCs repeatedly while using OV 5.0 under Win95
despite the fact that 5.0 was supposedly specifically designed to run
on that platform. I hope 5.1 is better.

OV 4.1 seems much more stable under Win95 than 5.0, although it is 
not free of problems (returning from a Windows screen saver while
in block mode causes a GPF, IXF doesn't work, and a few other little
jewels).

I am trying to use a Tandem 6530 terminal with an RS/6000

Probably not because I don't believe this was carried along in the C
implementation of the Tandem-specific functions.  You will have to
create your own.  It's pretty straightforward if you think through the
tasks that the TAL system calls perform.

If i understand your post correctly You may need to define the
terminal type in the telnet service (Base24)  parameter field.

For Example:

Under the Telnet services

The PROGRAM name is $SYSTEM.SYSTEM.PATHCOM the parameter should look
like
" $PPMN;RUN PS40-LOGON,TYPE 6:4"
The "TYPE 6:4" passes the terminal type to the application, and you
should be presented with a BASE24 logon screen. This is pretty typical
for blockmode applications running on a Telnet session.

Alex,

In order to do a good job of creating a new emulator you'll need a lot of
experience with the various versions of both Tandem and others 6530/6526
emulators.  Among the emulators that have existed are: PCT/PC6530, Tandem
Terminal Emulator (TTE), CAIL's T6530 (CTT), Crystal Point's Emulator,
FutureSoft's DynaComm Tandem 6530, CASEMaker's DRSE, and other's I can't
remember at this time (sorry to any of you I've forgotten to mention).

The single best source of information on the 6530 protocols is the 6530
Multipage Terminal Programming Guide that was published about 14 years ago.
 To my knowledge you'll have to find one that someone is willing to part
with as they are out of print and have been for a long time.  There are
also many user's guides and manuals from the emualtor vendors that can be
very helpful: CTT Communication Facility Operator Guide (CAIL Systems),
Tandem Terminal Emulators User's Guide, 6530 Multi-Page Terminal Users
Guide, PC6530 User's Guide (Tandem), 6526 Multi-Page Terminal Installation
and Operation Guide, etc.

A word of caution:  there are lots of undocumented "features" that you'll
have to find by testing your emulator with every piece of software Tandem
(and some customers) ever wrote.  If you are only going to support TCP/IP
it will cut down on the number of these nasty "got you" features that you
have to deal with.

For instance, how to do color register and palette mapping under host
control.   Of course, few people ever used this function, since Scobol
was not enhanced to support it (to the best of my knowledge).

My employer happens to be one of the odd companies which used 6530s
without Pathway and did exotic things with custom 6530 TAL programs, so
I happen to have all of this information sitting right on my desk.

Now, the question is just how much can I reproduce for others without
getting in trouble with Tandem on copyright issues?

The truth is that there are two flavors of telnet on NSK.  If you are doing
6530 terminal emulation, this happens against the Telnet well-known port but
it is a TACL process managing the session.  Only TACL commands work.  If you
want an OSS (i.e. UNIX) terminal session, you need to modify your TCP/IP
telnet server to offer OSS as an alternate command line interpreter.  When
you set this up, you get a sh shell and you get dropped in a default home
directory in the OSS file space.  If you don't know this, OSS is a UNIX
shell and SVR4 compliant implementation implemented on top of the NSK OS.
This shell interface will act like a real UNIX shell.  The terminal
emulation is typically VT-100.  I trust this clarifies things for you.

By no means can I claim to be an expert on T6530 escape sequences, but
I use a couple of them in my TACL code.  There are countless others,
of course, but that mythical manual that used to explain them all is
as rare as rare can get.

Note that in the notations below, to avoid confusion, I specify the
ASCII character code table entry numbers for each byte.  E.g.: <27>
means the escape character, <111> is a lower-case "o", etc.

Anyway, here are the ones I know:

clear screen to page 0 ==> <27><73>
start writing to line 25 ==> <27><111>
(writing to l25 is terminated by a carriage return/line feed)
turn on reverse video ==> <27><54><36>
turn on reverse video/dim ==> <27><54><37>
turn all attributes off ==> <27><54><40>

It's been ages since I coded these, so I don't even remember from
where I got the sequences, but they do work.  I do remember that the
third byte in the reverse video/dim sequences is a bit mask indicating
which attributes should be turned on or off, but that's as far as can
remember.  Hope that helps!

Subject: Re: Clearing 6530 terminal screen

The TACL Programming Manual clearly demonstrates the use of
a STRUCT and #DEF to clear the screen using ESC I (eye).
Code Follows:

?SECTION cls MACRO
#FRAME
==  define the clear screen escape sequence
[#DEF ascii STRUCT
   BEGIN
         BYTE  byt0 (0:1) value 27 73;     == decimal escape-I
         CHAR clear (0:1)  REDEFINES byt0;
   END;
]
#OUTPUT [ascii:clear(0:1)]
#UNFRAME

In TAL you would need to:
define a LITERAL  ESC = 27;
define clear  = ESC,"I"#;

and write it to the terminal.
Actually, after checking   ESC-I clears the memory (of the terminal).

Hope this helps.Tandem's Multipage Terminal Programming Manual
has been out of print for a long time.  How come the D48 manuals still
refer us back to a manual that is not in print and not on-line?

6530 family terminals (like the 6526) have a moderately complex async
protocol which is implemented in the old 36xx and 61xx controllers, and
nowadays in the AWAN terminal server products from Tandem (3883/4/5 and
soon 3886).  AWAN handles both the proprietary async protocol to the
terminal and the proprietary TN6530 protocol into Tandem Telserv.

Anything else treats the terminal like a dumb-ascii device - strictly
line by line mode.  If you want full screen, you have to get an AWAN.

Not sure what you are trying to accomplish; 1 terminal server and a terminal?

We have dircect terminals setup far away from the computer center in two ways:
1: tandem - TD MUX - dedicated serial cable - TD MUX - Terminal
2: tandem - terminal server - IP network (i.e. FTP cabling) - terminal server -
terminal

first solution is the simplest but requires dedicated cable
second solution needs some tweaking to get the break across; sometimes we need
a reset of
the terminal server ports after a cold load of the tandem.

Just follow the README_FLOSS for now and try to get it to work that way. 
Later you can try to break it 8-) by making changes to the config...

The hint not to use rhosts authentication comes as part of the openssh 
package, it hasn't been changed as part of the port to OSS. And rhosts-based
authentication isn't the most secure option, but I don't believe the OSS 
port supports another one. Maybe Tom Bates can shed a light on us here.

Depending on which terminal emulator you are using, you probably can do a
typical copy and paste to get the text from the screen into a PC file.
Also, I believe at least some of the terminal emulators have a way to log
all the interaction to a file, but you have to turn that on before doing the
things you want to capture.

But I imagine that isn't what you are asking for.  I think you want a TACL
command that will capture what is on the screen.

I don't remember any TACL command that does that.  The closest thing I can
think of to that is the EDIT ADD BLOCK command, but it probably isn't quite
what you want.  I have never tried this from within a TACL macro, but I have
done it interactively.  I think it would work from within a macro.  If you
execute the following command:

  EDIT file!;add block;exit

(Note, that is EDIT, not TEDIT.)  This will start the EDIT program, create
the new Edit file named "file", switch the terminal to block mode, keeping
all the text on the screen, then wait for you to press any function key.  If
at that point, you move the cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen,
then press any function key, EDIT will read the contents of the screen,
store it into "file", switch the terminal back to conversational mode, and
exit.  Since this requires operator action to move the cursor and press a
function key, it probably is not quite what you want.  Unless you are
watching the terminal carefully, it isn't very obvious when this command
gets executed, so you could have some trouble knowing when to do your part
by moving the cursor and pushing a function key.  You could have the macro
write a prompt to the screen before running the above command, but that
prompt would cause some of the screen contents to be lost since they would
scroll up off the top of
the screen.

I remember that when doing this intereactively, EDIT displayed its normal
startup line and a line about creating the new edit file, which caused the
top two lines to scroll off the screen.  I imagine that would also happen if
you used the command from inside a macro.

Given what the ADD BLOCK command can do, there probably is a sequence of
control characters that you could send to a terminal from within a TACL
macro via #outputv that would get the terminal to do something similar to
what ADD BLOCK does without requiring operator interaction.  I think you
could send control codes to move the cursor to the bottom, read the screen,
and switch back to conversational mode without waiting for a function key
press.  I would have to study the 6530 terminal's programming manual to see
what control codes would do that (assuming it is possible).  Maybe someone
else already knows the proper control character sequence and can answer the
question without research.  Or maybe there is a little utility program
someone can give you that does the whole operation, including storing the
text into a file.

Hello Manu,

It's been a while, you may have got what you needed already...

Well, if not, the TAL source below does what you want. It was
originally written in 1984, and I never bothered to "enlighten" the
code, but it should run fine on any NonStop server. To compile:
TAL / IN source / object; SUPPRESS.
