In the Millenial era, some users have been seeking a software package
that runs under Microsoft Windows which emulates several models of
Tektronix terminals.  Some are mentioned in the archived discussion
below, but one vendor of special interest may be Neoware, which sells
the following terminal-emulation programs:

    teemtalk-05    emulates Tektronix 4105
    teemtalk-07    emulates Tektronix 4207
    teemtalk-11    emulates Tektronix 4111

As of spring A.D. 2004, "teemtalk" is available from Neoware:

    http://www.neoware.com/products/teemtalk/teemtalk_for_graphics.html

(Previously this product was obtained from Pericom Software.)
(There is also an available teemtalk VT340/ReGIS graphics emulation.)

For some information on the Tektronix 4010 graphics, terminal, you can
see information from the Kermit Project:

Subject: Tek 4107 setup

Today I had occasion to set up a real Tektronix 4107 color graphics
terminal.  And I dug out the real operators manual, which is

    "Tek Operators Manual: 4107/4109 Computer Display Terminals"
    Part Number 070-4981-00 (Product Group 18) published in 1983 by

    Tektronix Inc.
    Information Display Division
    Graphics Desktop Products Group IDD1
    Wilsonville Industrial Park
    PO Box 1000
    Wilsonville, OR 97070  USA

Other books of interest:

    "4107/4109 Programmmers Reference Manual" Part Number 070-4893-00
    "4107/4109 Reference Guide"               Part Number 070-4892-00
    "4107 Service Manual"                     Part Number 070-4889-00
    "4109 Service Manual"                     Part Number 070-4899-00

A couple of non-obvious things that might help somebody else:

The second-from-left key on the top (function) row of the keyboard is
the SETUP key. (This is to the right of the "joydisk".)  When you
press this key, the terminal should display an asterisk (*) on the
screen; it is now in SETUP mode.  To display (quickly) all the current
modes, type the command:

    *STAT

you can find out a single parameter like this:

    *STAT PARITY

I wanted the Tek terminal to approximate a DEC VT100 terminal for text.
The command to set this is

    *CODE EDIT

I discovered that "CODE ANSI" set up the scrolling region in a way I
did not like.  The "Edit" mode sets the following parameters for you:

     DALINES       24
     DABUFFER      24
     DAENABLE     YES
     DAVISIBILITY YES

Key macros may be enabled in "Edit" mode by giving the Setup command

    *ENABLE KEY EXPANSION

There are lots of possible macro keys; Control-A is macro number 1,
Control-B is 2, up to Control-Z.  Control-1 is 49, Control-2 is 50,
etc.  There are more, but you'd better get the real documentation
before trying them. Some commands are

    *DEFINE F6 "arbitrary text"

to define a text-string macro and assign it to the F6 key.  Also:

    *MACROSTATUS macro-specifier                 (or ALL)
    *NVDEFINE    macro-specifier macro-contents  (for permanent memory)

Communication parameters are always of interest.  Here are mine:

    *BAUDRATE  9600
    *STOPBITS     1
    *PARITY    NONE
    *XMITLIMIT 9600       (upper limit on transmitting to host)
    *ECHO        NO       (echoing characters locally)
    *LOCAL       NO
    *CRLF        NO       (carriage return implies linefeed)
    *IGNOREDEL   NO       (terminal ignores incoming Delete characters)
    *AUTOREPEAT YES
    *AUTOWRAP   YES

You can set a character set:

    *SELECTCHARSET G0 A   (United Kingdom)
    *SELECTCHARSET G0 B   (United States/ASCII)
    *SELECTCHARSET G0 G   (Sweden)
    *SELECTCHARSET G0 K   (Germany)
    *SELECTCHARSET G0 f   (France)
    *SELECTCHARSET G0 '   (Danish/Norwegian)
    *SELECTCHARSET G0 0   (Rulings)
    *SELECTCHARSET G0 3   (Supplementary set)

    *SELECTCHARSET G1 3   (Supplementary set in G1)

Now, you've got the setup the way you like it.  Then do

    *NVSAVE 

to make the terminal memorize the settings.  This is specified to
work 10,000 times before wearing out.  (This stands for "non-volatile
memory save".)

You can always try

    *HELP

if all else fails, or  

    *FACTORY

if you get helplessly lost.

To get out of Setup mode, press the SETUP key again.

It's been quite some time since I've dealt with the Retro Graphics card,
and I don't have a manual either.  But it is very similar to the Tektronix
4010, which you can get documentation on fairly easily.

I've pulled these sequences from an old graphics package that used the
Retro Graphics card as one of its output devices.  I don't make any claim
that they are complete, but they should be reasonably correct :-).

Note that in addition to the 4010 sequences the Retro Graphics-equipped
VT100 would also support all of the VT100 escape sequences as well...

NUL		- Delay timing
GS		- Go to cursor position mode.
US		- Go to alphanumerics mode

ESC FF		- Clear screen

ESC " 0 g	- Set normal graphics mode
ESC " 1 g	- (don't remember - not used by package)
ESC " 2 g	- (don't remember - not used by package)
ESC " 3 g	- (don't remember - not used by package)
ESC " 4 g	- Read locator position (convert to mouse under X?)
     
ESC :		- Set character size (small - 7 x 8)
ESC 8		- Set character size (large - 12 x 24)

ESC 0		- I think these also set character size, but they weren't used
ESC 1		- by the graphics package for some reason, but are mentioned in
ESC 2		- the comments.
ESC 3		-

ESC / 0 d	- Set mode for vectors etc.  Pixels set along vector.
ESC / 1 d	- Clear mode for vectors etc.  Pixels cleared along vector.
ESC / 2 d	- Complement mode for vectors etc.  Pixels complemented
		  along vector (XOR mode).

ESC / f		- Some kind of prompting mode (rubber band line?)

ESC `		- Set various hardware line styles.  I don't remember what
ESC a		- they were any more.  (The graphics package allowed the
ESC b		- application program to request a hardware-generated line
ESC c		- style like dotted, dashed, etc, for efficiency purposes.
ESC d		- The comments in the source didn't tell what these styles
ESC e		- were.  Most programs used software generated line styles
ESC f		- anyway, they are more reproduceable between different
ESC g		- display devices).  ESC ` is a solid line though.

In character position mode, the first coordinate causes the pen to move
to the position without drawing, then subsequent coordinates cause the
pen to draw in the current line style and drawing mode.

That's all the sequences the package used - I know there were others so
this isn't complete.  You might find a few in documentation for the 4010 if
you can find that (I also have code that wrote to the 4010 but it doesn't
use any additional sequences & I don't have my 4010 documentation any more).
I do know that the Retro Graphics card used some sequences not implemented
in the Tektronix terminals (the various modes like "complement vector" have
no meaning on storage tubes), so I have no guarantee that this list is
anywhere near complete, just that it was enough for the old graphics package.

If you need help cracking the vector position sequence I can dig that up
too, but that should be less trouble decoding (at least if the package you're
converting is reasonably well written).

Good luck -

Bruce C. Wright

There exists a commercial program called TGRAF-07 that emulates a
Tektronix 4107 on IBM PC/AT type equipment.  When I last checked, it
did cost a nontrivial amount of money.

The vendor is Grafpoint, in San Jose, California.  Call +1 408/446-1919.

If you can get by with only monochrome, 4010/4014 Tek graphics, Joe
Doupnik's MS-Kermit program can do the job, and can be obtained for
free from Columbia University.

I'm currently writing a Tektronix 4014 emulator, and I was able to get hold
of a copy of the original 4014 service manual (Tektronix Part #070-1648-00,
dated 8/74).  I ordered it via InterLibrary Loan, without much trouble.
It has everything, including circuit diagrams.
   
So now I'm an expert on obscure things like `Special Point Plot Mode' and
`Incremental Plot Mode'.  Anyone who has Tektronix questions, let me know.

Martin asked about incremental plot mode, specifically.  Incremental plot
mode is entered with \036 (a single byte).  Commands in incremental plot
mode are single bytes too.  They include any of the bytes in the string
" ABDEFHIJP".  The only way to exit from incremental plot mode is to send
the Tektronix 4014 a \037 byte, which causes it to enter alpha mode 
(i.e. text mode).

The meaning of the incremental motion commands is as follows: 
' ' is pen up, 'A' is east, 'B' is west, 'D' is north, 'E' is northeast, 
'F' is northwest, 'H' is south, 'I' is southeast, 'J' is southwest, 
'P' is pen down.  All but the first and the last draw short vectors
(extending no more than one unit in the horizontal and vertical
directions). 

I could talk about Special Point Plot Mode too, but I won't; unlike
incremental plot mode, present-day emulators aren't capable of doing it.
(In Special Point Plot mode, a Tektronix 4014 adjusted the beam intensity,
and defocused the beam too, so as to render each plotted point individually.)

Incidentally, is anyone still using a genuine Tektronix 4014?  I have some
code I'd like to try out on one.

Tektronix emulation supports a set of escape sequences that originally
were designed for drawing strokes (line segments) in any of four styles
(dashed, etc.) on storage tube displays.  Also, characters could be
plotted (horizontal orientation only) at any of the (typically 1024x768,
or 4 times that for larger models) coordinate locations, in any of four
fixed sizes.  Tektronix terminals also had a pair of thumbwheels on the
keyboard for steering around a "graphic cursor" whose location could be
read using still another escape sequence.  Later extensions included
"incremental point plotting" and "defocussing".  (Also the extra bits of
resolution for coordinates on the larger displays.)

Storage tubes were not raster-scan devices and did not support bitmaps.

As to how to program a Tektronix display, if you don't have the user's
manual then probably your best bet is to look in an older edition of
Newman & Sproull or Foley & Van Dam.

It's really rather trivial.  Basically, for alphanumeric mode, it's a
regular dumb terminal (albeit with two columns of overstriking text,
rather than the usual single page of replacing text).  To enter graphics
mode, you send a GS (hex 1D) character.  To exit back to alpha state,
you send a US (hex 1F) character.

After sending a GS, the "pen" is "up" -- meaning that the first
coordinate given will not cause any drawing to occur, but will just
move the current pen position.  You can send GS at any time to move
the pen.

The coordinates are encoded as:

	[ HiY ] [ LoY [ HiX ] ] LoX

Each portion encodes 5 bits of a 10 bit composite number (the drawing
surface is therefore 1024x1024, though most displays are only 1024x768).
Sending a LoX value causes the movement to occur and causes the pen to
go down (start drawing).  If you want to change the HiX value, you must
send LoY (even if it doesn't change) because the encoding for HiY and
HiX are indistinguishable.  And you must always send LoX to cause the
movement or drawing to occur, even if you don't want to change the LoX
value.

The alpha position is set to the last pen position when returning to
alpha mode.

The encodings for each byte are:

	HiY and HiX	value + 0x20
	LoY		value + 0x60
	LoX		value + 0x40

Where "value" is the indicated 5-bit portion of the 10-bit number.

For instance, here's a box around a 1024x768 screen (in hex):

	1D 20 60 20 40 60 3F 5F 37 7F 5F 7F 20 40 20 60 40 1F

There's also a point-plotting mode and an extension that adds two more
bits of precision in both directions, but I'm not as familiar with
those.

I had this phase, too, some time ago ;-)

But there's not very much.  I found:

- gnuplot
     it can produce quite usable Tek output

- plot2tek
     can convert Unix plot format into Tek format, so you're able
     to use any plot-capable programm (e.g., pbmtoplot) to display
     B/W pictures.

  (There's also tplot, t4014, tek, which all claim to do the same
   but didn't work on my Solaris machine.)

Unfortunately, not (that I know of).

That'd be cool! :-)

Solaris 2.x and lots of other SVR4's include a program called "posttek" which
does what you want.  Two of your listed vendor's do SOME things is a SYSV
way.

It would be simplest to add the UltraScript (aka "turbo") upgrade
to your existing Imagen printer (assuming it's a 300dpi model).

Unfortunately, UNIX plotting support has eroded over the years,
and there is now no "standard" way to convert Tek4014 to PostScript.
If you can find a tool that converts Tek4014 to some semi-standard
plot file format, probably the rest of the job can be done with a
pipeline of various conversion utilities, e.g.

	tek2plot | pltroff | troff -Tps

Good luck!

Adobe Systems (promulgator of the Postscript page-description language)
has a software package called "transcript"; this seems to have as a
component a thing called "ps4014", which can take a file written for
Tek 4014 vector output and convert it for printing on a Postscript
printer.

Contact Adobe Systems directly for more information.

Hello:

Caveat: I am the marketing director for FTG Data Systems.

My company makes an emulator called EMU-TEK which does all the popular Tek
emulation types. For university students, we have a special deal where you
can get the University version (which only works over a modem) for $99.
Recommend to others who buy, and we'll refund your $99 (or buy three at
once for $198).

EMU-TEK is available in Windows or Dos versions and the Windows version
can output your graphics to Metafile format, so that you can inport into
other Windows applications and print at the highest res of your printer.

If you would like mroe information, you can email me here, or else call
800-962-3900 (+1 714/995-3900) and we send you out more info, or a copy
of EMU-TEK with a full 30-day money-back guarantee.

Thanks,
Ron

FTG Data Systems has an emulator for Windows that is called EMU-TEK for
Windows. It does what you need.

Normally it runs $495, but if you are a university student, there is a
limited version for $99. The limited version does all that the full
version does, but it can only hook up over a modem or serial port, not
through a network. If your interested, please email me or call
800-962-3900 and ask for the University Edition of EMU-TEK.

It has a 30-day money-back guarantee if you don't like it for any reason.

Thanks,
Ron

P.S. I work for FTG, so my opinion may be a little slanted!

Using MS-Kermit in the following way enables tektronix graphics support
where it may not be supported (as well) otherwise.

COMTCP comes with OS/2 IBM TCPIP 2.0 and with Warp Connect. To run MS-Kermit
telnet via COMTCP, get the latest MS-Kermit patch file, and see the following
notes:

COMTCP is a DOS box command and works as follows:

            COMTCP hostname kermit patch, set port bios1, stay

       (i.e., no MSKERMIT.INI used; also worked with MSKERMIT.INI issuing
       PATCH and SET PORT BIOS1). After the above command, at the MS-Kermit>
       prompt, to Telnet, simply issue MSK subcommand: Connect
       and login to the host telnetted to as usual.

       Notes:
          (1) A separate WIN-OS2 (DOS) session using TCP/IP 2.0 Winsock, and
              a separate OS/2 TCP/IP 2.0 Webexplorer session, was running
              simultaneous with the above COMTCP Kermit session. That is,
              COMTCP is correctly multi-threaded by OS/2 Warp and TCP/IP 2.0.

          (2) A DOS Windowed session can be used to conduct a Telnet session.
              However, if a Windowed DOS session was used to do Tek Plotting,
              when the (Gnuplot) plot subcommand is issued, OS/2 Warp opens
              an Information Window which reads:
              "The system does not support this session's video in a window"
              and the DOS Window title changes to: Suspended: Kermit.exe
              At this point the connection to the Vax remains intact; clicking
              on the DOS Window Control Menu box (upper left-hand corner) and
              choosing Full-Screen from that menu (or pressing Warp hot key
              Alt-Home which toggles between DOS Window and DOS Fullscreen
              for that virtual DOS session) resumes the Vax session dialog,
              and then the Tek Plot displays as though DOS Full-screen was
              chosen in the first place.

Subject: Tektronix 4010 comm problems

I have a real live 4010 that I'm trying to get working.

It seems to mostly work ok in local mode, the only issues are keys with 
ascii ending in 0001 (1, A, Q) giving wrong/random characters.

It works in line mode with a loopback plug on the 25 pin port.

I'm a bit confused about the TTY/RS-232 configurations, there is a 
jumper on the TTY control board that selects one or the other, and seems 
to like being in RS-232 mode.  There is a switch on the back by the 
ports which selects AUX OFF TTY, which seems to like being in the TTY 
position.  There are some jumpers soldered on the TTY interface board. 
The baud and clock jumpers don't seem to have any effect in RS232 mode, 
which may be normal.

I'm trying to get it to listen and talk to a PC using a serial port.  I 
have got garbled garbage thru both ways, but I'd like it to work right....

It appears to be running at 4800 bps, with 7 bits.

Any info, manual scans, war stories, etc greatly appreciated!

The 4010 had a number of optional interfaces. The one you have is a
tty port i/f, with 20ma current loop. There was also the possibility
of switching to RS232c levels. There were a number of options which
this hardware was used for, coming with instructions on how to install
it on a selection of mini-computers, e.g. PDP 05, PDP 11, Data General
Nova. It is not the ideal interface for RS232c connections, but will
work.

You actually have a piece of history there. Prior to the 4010 the
cheapest graphic terminal (certainly that I knew of) cost 4500 UKP,
the 4010 with standard i/f sold for under 2000 UKP. The result was the
market was flooded with them, and companies suddenly had cheap
graphics at the disposal.

I see what you mean about being "not the ideal" for 232...it's been a 
pain to get set up, and the clock thing without a crystal oscillator is 
just plain stupid design.  Being a piece of Tektronix gear, this is 
surprising, but I suppose data communications was not a big thing for 
them at the time?

Speaking of Novas...there is a little sticker with handwriting 
describing a couple of settings for use with a Nova, inside the bottom 
cover.  So, that may be what it was connected to (at one time).  My 
brother recalls that there were several Novas at the U of Arizona (where 
my 4010 came from, per the property tag sticker).  He worked at Optical 
Sciences there about 20 yrs ago.  I mentioned the 4010 to my dad, and he 
was immediately familar with it...he worked around the U of A for many 
years in the astronomy instrumentation business.

The standard and option 1 interfaces which were for RS232c were
crystal controlled. Certainly you would have found the option 1 i/f
much easier to use.

The way the 4010 with a tty port i/f was installed involved amongst
other things replacing the mini's i/o board clock with the clock from
the terminal tty card. Hence there were no problems with
synchronisation.

The terminal transmit clock was at a comparatively slow speed whilst
the data from the computer was transferred at high speed. So the
maximum baud rate was set at the highest that the mini's i/o board
could handle. Also whilst the terminal was busy it stopped the clock,
hence could not be overrun by the mini.

Graphics are done be encoding x and y values from 0 to 1023 into ASCII
characters (I can even remember how to do it, and shortened
addressing). Each vector (line) takes 2.6 ms to complete and can
require from 1 to 4 ASCII characters. So the stop/start of the clock
ensured graphics at maximum speed.

Hey, there was no need to say how long ago, I'm feeling old enough :-)

Ah....now it makes sense.  It's ususally those missing pieces that cause 
the great mysteries!

I've found a few different explanations of the graphics encoding method, 
as well as times for various operations (clear screen is allowed 1.5 
seconds, for example).

I don't have a minicomputer, I mostly have MS-DOS machines (ranging in age
from a 1982 IBM PC to a-few-years-ago 1.0GHz generic), plus some Kaypro
CP/M luggables.  I suppose if I were serious,  I'd try to set up Linux
on something and see if I can use Unix plotting  software...but instead,
I'm playing with BASIC to try to get something interesting on the display
of the 4010.

I have it working to the point  that I can type in the appropriate
character to move and draw lines, but  calculating what that character
is by hand takes awhile...so I need to  do some programming to handle
the job.  But since I'm not much of a  programmer, there is a learning
curve involved.  Last year I started to  do just a tad of 8088 assembly
programming, but didn't get very  far...although I do have a few books
on the subject.  What's frustrating  is that my brothers can talk to
microprocessors in binary as a second language (perhaps a first
language, and English is second)...but I never  learned, because my
interests have usually been somewhere else.

If you have any 8088 or Z80 routines to talk to a 4010, let me know  :)

Thanks again for the info!

To use the graphics:

1) Generate X and Y co-ordinates, scaled to fit in the range 0 thru
   1023 for both (only 0 thru ~767 visible in Y, but line heads off in
   the right direction and return from the right direction).

2) Create HiY, LoY, HiX and LoX co-ordinates:

HiY=int(Y/32)
Loy=Y-(HiY*32
HiX=int(X/32)
Lox=X-(HiX-32)

3) Convert to the encoded ASCII characters

HiY Byte=chr(HiY+32)
LoY Byte=chr(LoY+96)
HiX Byte=chr(Hix+32)
LoX Byte=chr(LoX+64)

4) Send out in order Hiy, LoY, HiX, Lox. Make sure that these
   characters are not followed by LF or CR!!!!!

To go into Graphics mode send a GS character (29), the first vector
after a GS is a move, subsequent ones are draws. To exit Graphics mode
send a US character (31) or a CR (13) - the difference is that a US
will leave the alpha cursor at the last graphic addressed point, a CR
does a return as well, putting the alpha cursor at the lefthand margin.

Addressing can at time be shortened, but bear in mind the 2.6 millisecs-
per-vector rule, otherwise odd effects occur. To shorten addresses is a
little more complex and probably not worth doing even at only 4800 bps.

Clearing the screen on a 4010 takes 1 second, the 19" screen terminals
take 1.5 seconds (often 1.5 seconds is used to save the bother of
finding out which terminal is in use).

Oh, GIN mode works slightly differently; you won't be using that, I presume?

Yup, I discovered all that...and got it working already (see link in my 
sig).  But the info I had was not nearly as concise as your explanation! 

I'm saving your post in my 4010 folder  :)

I got into GIN mode, and the crosshairs move around when I twiddle the 
knobs....but I haven't gone so far as to try to read the position 
coordinates (there's a command to send to the 4010 to get the cursor 
position, I think it's Escape control-E).

Thanks!

There are 2 modes of reading the GIN co-ordinates, interactive and
non-interactive.

Interactive mode: the Xhair cursor is displayed, the operator moves it
to the required position and then presses a key (NOT the return key!).
A sequence of bytes is sent to the computeras follows:

The ASCII value of the key pressed e.g. D
HiX byte - 01 followed by the 5 most significant X bits
LoX byte - 01 followed by the 5 least significant X bits
HiY byte - 01 followed by the 5 most significant Y bits
LoY byte - 01 followed by the 5 least significant Y bits

This sequence is followed by the termination character(s) as set by
a jumper set on the TC2 card within the terminal. The most common
setting is to send the CR character.

To recreate the X and Y values:

X=(32*(HiX-32))+(LoX-32)
Y=(32*(HiY-32))+(LoY-32)

In non-interactive mode the computer sends <ESC><ENQ>. The sequence
returned is as above, except that the keycode is replaced by a status
byte, this gives information as to whether the terminal is in Alpha,
Graphics or GIN mode. I cannot at the moment remember which bit does
what.

Regards,

Michael

That brings back memories: I wrote "C" libraries for such things long
long ago. It was mostly converting coordinates to the commands, allowing
different scaling, etc.

Non-interactive crosshair reading and writing dots to current position
(or lines from "last position" to current position)
makes for an etch-a-sketch!

I think command timing was mentioned: when using the "short draw commands"
(2-3 characters instead of 4) it's possible to give commands faster than
they can be executed, particularly for long line drawing.
(I remember getting streaked/dotted lines instead of solid)
I probably commented out such optimizations
since it was more trouble than it was worth.

A few years later the college got DEC GiGi terminals.
That was a dead-end technology!

Thanks for this excellent hint!

Searching the GNU Web site http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/ I found very quickly
the "graphics" package including the "plot2tek" filter that works like a
charm (everthing compiled fine on a Sparc 10 running SunOs).

Now I only need this little filter chain to display images:
  ...to_pbm_format... | pbmtoplot | plot | plot2tek

Great!

I know that both the computer algebra system "Maple" and the plotting
program "gnuplot" can produce Tek output. I haven't tested that extensively
but it seemed to work alright.

Hello Robert,

thanks a lot!!!

Though I knew that there is such a thing like "incremental plot mode"
from reading the xterm code sequence description I hadn't been able to
get any specific information on this mode so far. It's really not easy
to get those antique manuals here ... :-)

Thank you for the help!

        Well ... *most* CRTs.  If you've ever used a Tektronix 4010 or
relative, you'll remember that those had persistance that wouldn't stop.
(Actually, they were storage screens, and had to be intentionally erased

You may want to have a look at the new GNU plotting utilities package,
available as "plotutils-1.1.tar.gz" at all GNU mirror sites, such as

    ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/GNU/

I'm the primary author.

The package includes a library for 2-D device-independent graphics, and one
of the supported devices is the Tektronix 4014.  I added a fair number of
comments to the code explaining what it does: what the Tektronix escape
sequences are, etc.  Look at the files in libs/libplottek, especially
tek_mode.c and putcode.c.

If there's enough demand, I'll eventually write something more substantial.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: GNU plotting utilities 2.0 released

Release 2.0 of the GNU plotting utilities is now available at
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/plotutils-2.0.tar.gz .  It should soon be
available via ftp from the GNU mirror sites.  A list of mirror sites is
appended below; please try them before you try ftp.gnu.org.

This is a major release.  The centerpiece of the package is now `libplot',
a function library for 2-D device-independent graphics.  Libplot is
installed as a DLL (dynamically linked library), on systems that support
DLL's.  Libplot now supports Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HP-GL and
HP-GL/2) output, in addition to Postscript, xfig, Tektronix, and X11 output.
So HP LaserJet and other PCL 5 printers are now supported.

Sample applications built on libplot include `graph', `plot', and
`tek2plot'.  Also included in the package are `ode', which integrates a
system of ordinary differential equations, and the GNU version of `spline'.

The chief user-visible change from version 1.x is that the separate
device-dependent versions of `graph', `plot', and `tek2plot' have been
merged.  The output format is now specified with the `-T' option.  
`graph -T ps' replaces `graph-ps', etc.  Also, the Tektronix translator
`tek2plot' is now fully documented and uses the same parser that
the X Window System Tektronix emulator uses.

The manual for the plotting utilities is now over 100 pages long.  To
install and print the documentation, be sure that you have the current
release of the GNU texinfo package (v. 3.11) installed on your system.
You may retrieve it from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/texinfo-3.11.tar.gz .

Enjoy.

Someone kindly suggested that I mention some of the capabilities of
these terminals, primarily that they do a good VT100 emulation (albeit
with a slightly different keyboard layout).

Other details include:
- modes: TEK 4100, 4010, ANSI X3.64, DEC VT100, DEC VT52
- nonvolatile RAM stores configurations
- interface to colour or monochrome printers, plotters,
  digitizing tablets (we've got some tablets with pucks),

- 640x480 individually addressable pixels on a 13" screen,
  .31" dot pitch, 60Hz refresh
- up to 16 colours from a palette of 64
- independent graphics and text display control (so you can have text
  interface overlayed on graphics, in the days before dual monitor
  CAD stations)
- 4096x4096 addressable coordinate system, and a lot of really
  amazing graphics capabilities
- 256k RAM (we used it for storing large images so that
  graphics pan and zoom operations were local and hence very fast)
- max. 38.4kbps comm speed
- 80 or 132 column text modes, horizontal and vertical scroll buffers
- downloadable/definable character sets

Anyway, it's a very interesting little machine.  They will be dumped
soon as the MicroVAX 3400-based CAD system they were used on for years
is being retired (anyone interested in a used VAX? - email me for
details).

Bzzt.  The Tek Phaser 140 was, indeed, an aqueous inkjet.  No wax, no
thermal processes.  It cost much more than non-PostScript inkjets and
didn't do well in the market.  There were no followups in the Phaser
100 series.

Here's a guide:

Phaser 1xx: aqueous inkjet
Phaser 2xx: thermal wax (the "ribbon" was made up of page-size panels of
            colored wax)
            includes earlier "Phaser II" line
Phaser 3xx: "phase change" aka solid ink (blocks of crayon-like wax)
            includes earlier "Phaser III" line
Phaser 4xx: dye sublimation
Phaser 5xx: color laser
Phaser 6xx: wide-carriage solid ink "poster printers"
Phaser 7xx: recent color lasers
Phaser 8xx: recent solid ink

The Tek 4000 series of terminals were weird designs in many ways.

They had a bus structure of sorts-- but it wasn't interlocked, so keyboard data
could corrupt incoming data.  Usually didnt happen at the common baud rates,
but was a huge pain on full-duplex connections.

All the PC boards were gold-plated, for no particularly good reason.

The Control-G bell was a rather elaborate design, with it's own digital
counter to count off the cycles of audio sent to the speaker.

But the baud-rate generator was a unijunction R-C oscillator--as it
warmed up, it would tend to drift off freq far enough to garble incoming
data.    This on a $5,000 terminal.

You had to turn off all the room lights to use the thing, screen was too dim.

If you wanted hard-copy, you needed an $8,000 Tek printer.  The printing
process was an analog nightmare, with a scanning beam reading the data right
off the screen (the original and literal screen-scraper!), conveying it to
another really weird one-line CRT which tried to impress the data onto very
special silver-coated paper, which was then developed by some hot rollers.

The screen data was usually fuzzy to begin with-- after those many analog
transfer steps, the resulting printout usually looked like an exploding toner
cartridge in a snowstorm.

And, if I recall correctly, all the early versions were UPPER CASE ONLY.

  [snip]

And the hard-copy faded very rapidly with *any* exposure to light. We
used to immediately Xerox any copies we wanted to keep. For doing a lot
of copies, this was a pain made worse because the paper came from a roll
and tended to curl instead of lying flat. In spite of these and other
problems, it was the best available at the time.

I recall working with (evaluating, actually) a terminal which said "Gas
Plasma Display" on the back.  It had bright red images on a very faintly red
background.  There was a "black adjust", but if you went far enough to get
black, the images became a bit washed out.  This must have been before 1983
because I was looking into this for use with ComputerVision CAD systems.

It had a full character generator and did vector graphics, but not at the
same time.  Putting it in graphics mode and doing normal text work on it was
a sight to behold.  Very "sci-fi" in appearance.  Looked a lot like the text
displays in Battlestar Galactica when Adama did his diary entries, except it
was red.

Look more carefully at some of that "sci-fi" stuff.  In "Silent Running"
Bruce Dern is talking into a Tektronix  scope, something like a 454.
At one point, he even flips one of the switches, so he can transmit.

Mind you, I had the use of one around the same time, and a friend
of a friend who was over once, later described it as a "multi-color
oscilliscope" or something like that.
