If you must use it in VT220 mode, then use CTRL-3 or CTRL-[ to send an
ESC code.  Alternatively, you could use the following control sequence
(say, in a .login file) to program SHIFT-F13 as ESC (there's no way to
program unshifted function keys on a real DEC VT220), but this way looks
like overkill:

	<ESC>P1;1|25/1B<ESC>\

Editor's note:

Almost all ASCII terminals, including all DEC VT models,
will generate the Escape (ESC) character (0x1B) if you
hold down the Control/CTRL key and type the LEFT bracket:

    Control-[  ==  ESC

whereas if you mistakenly hit the right bracket ] you will
generate the GS (group separator) control code (0x1D) 
(which many "telnet" implementations use as a command escape).

Note that the DEC LK201 sometimes has a function key that
bears the label "F11 (ESC)", but it generates a raw Escape
character ONLY when the VT220 or VT320 is set to operate
in "VT100 mode".  Otherwise, this key sends one of two
control-character sequences--in 7-bit mode:

    ESC [ 2 3 ~

or in 8-bit mode:

    CSI 2 3 ~

where CSI (0x9B) is the ANSI X3.64 Control Sequence Introducer.

From: hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com (Bill Hedberg)
Subject: Re: Keyboard input question

	Function Keys in VT100 emulation are undefined.

	Terminals and terminal emulators typically define multi-byte
control strings of the form "<Esc>[XX" as defaults for Function Keys.
Function Key strings do not have a global meaning.  They are just a unique
signal to the host which indicate that a particular key was pressed.

	The orginal Digital VT100 did not have Function Keys.

	Yes, the VT100 did have [PF1],[PF4],[PF3],[PF4], but it did not
have [F1].. keys.  Function Keys [F1]..[F20] first appeared on the
keyboard of the VT220, where [F1]..[F3] were defined as Local Function
Keys, ie. [F1]=Hold Screen, [F2]=Print, [F3]=Set-Up.  [F11]=Esc,
[F12]=BS and [F13]=LF in VT100 mode only as a hack.  Esc, BS and LF
were removed as independent keys on the VT220 keyboard.

	Follow-on Digital VT products attempted to emulate VT100 mode
by disabling (except [F11]..[F13]).  VT100 clones intentionally or
unintentionally mapped Function Keys in VT100 emulation, but Function
key mappings are inconsistent across vendors.

Subject: Re: My vt320 termcap file

Regarding the F5 key:

Somebody else may point this out, but on a real DEC VT220 or VT320,
the first five top-row function keys are intended primarily as local
functions, not as things a remote application program can sense;
indeed F1 through F4 don't send anything to the host at all.


On a VT420 (for which I've got the manual here)

    KEY     FUNCTION
    ---     ------------------------------------------------------------
    F1      Hold (controls scrolling via XON/XOFF).

    F2      Local Print (prints screen to locally attached printer).
              Shift-F2 (on VT320) prints graphics and text.
            Control-F2 toggles auto-print mode.

    F3      Enter terminal's setup mode.

    F4      Switch sessions (for dual-session terminals).
            Control-F4 splits screen (for dual-session terminals).

    F5      Break (sends long serial break).
            Shift-F5 drops DTR to disconnect a modem.
            Control-F5 sends the terminal's answerback message to the
            remote host.

However, the more recent VT420 product can be configured (by use of
the setup menus) to have the F1 through F5 keys really send a code
sequence to the host instead of performing the local operation.  The
code sequences are of the form

     Esc [ 1 2 ~

in 7-bit communication environments or

     CSI   1 2 ~

in 8-bit communication environments.

    KEY     7-BIT CODE
    ---     -----------
    F1      Esc [ 1 1 ~
    F2      Esc [ 1 2 ~
    F3      Esc [ 1 3 ~
    F4      Esc [ 1 4 ~
    F5      Esc [ 1 5 ~

However, if you configure the VT420's first five function keys this
way, you lose the capability to perform their local functions, one of
which (F3) is to allow you to use the setup menus!  To recover from
this condition, you have to log out, turn off the terminal, wait 10
seconds, turn on the terminal, and then make F3 the very first key you
press after it has initialized.  Then the terminal enters setup mode,
and you can change the use of F3 (or other parameters).

Just for completeness, the keypad function keys emit

    KEY     8-BIT CODE
    ---     -----------
    PF1     SS3 P
    PF2     SS3 Q

P.S.

If you just want to be able to type certain ASCII Control codes,
you can generate them by holding down the Control key and typing
these numeric digits on the alphanumeric side of the keyboard:

    KEYSTROKE   CODE  CHAR HEX
    ---------   ----  ---- ---
    Control-2   NUL   ^@   00
    Control-3   ESC   ^[   1B        (yes, Control-[ also emits ESC)
    Control-4   FS    ^\   1C
    Control-5   GS    ^]   1D
    Control-6   RS    ^^   1E        (shift not required)
    Control-7   US    ^_   1F
    Control-8   DEL        7F


 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Another frequently asked question:

Q: Is there a way to cause the big key with the backward-pointing
arrow to send a Backspace (Control-H) code instead of the Delete code?

A: In the VT300 and later models, there is the DECBKM control for this:

    ESC [ 6 7 h      set backarrow key to send backspace

    ESC [ 6 7 l      set backarrow key to send delete  (that's lowercase L)

Actually, the DEC keyboards follow the formal standard in sending the
Delete code with this key; however, in some computer communities, the
users seem to expect Backspace from this key.

There are also some Unix shell and stty settings that affect this.
Read  "man stty" for information.

Subject: Summary: KVMs, LK461 and DECwindows

    Some time ago, I started a thread titled, "KVM between PWS600au
and IBM T20 Laptop".  I now have an update and perhaps another
question or two.

Executive Summary:

    The Rose Mini-Vista KVM "works" well between a PC running
Windows XP and an Alpha running VMS and DECwindows.  However, when
using an LK461-A2 keyboard, the 6-key editing keypad, function keys
F18-F20, and the numeric keypad minus keys are mapped incorrectly on 
the Alpha, and the top-row functions keys from F13 through F17, and the
Compose key, are not available at all.

    Most KVM vendors support only a standard PC 101/102-key
keyboard, but in there higher-end KVM series, Rose say they fully 
support the LK461 keyboard.


Details:

    I have an IBM T20 Laptop [this is my work platform] plugged into 
its port-replicator (which allows me to use a standard keyboard,
mouse and monitor), and a PWS600au hobbiest system.  I wanted to
share a sungle LK461-A2 keyboard, 3-button mouse (Digital logo) and
Samsung SyncMaster LCD monitor at home through an appropriate KVM
switch.

    The issues that I knew to research at the time were that the laptop
(on its port-replictor) wanted the keyboard in mode 2, whereas the VMS
(and I think Tru64) want the keyboard in mode 3.
The mouse stays in PS2 mode (if that's the right term) for both
platforms, and this LCD takes analog input so there were no 
compatibility problems there either.

    I found three candidate vendors (there may be more) which would
maintain the keyboard in different modes on different KVM ports:
Adder, Raritan and Rose Electronics.  When I looked into the Raritan, I
found it requires a "converter" on any port that runs in
other than mode 2, and the cost of the converter plus the KVM was
more than I wanted to spend.  I almost bought the small Adder 2-port 
model, but after exchanging some correspondance with tech support at 
Rose, wound up buying the Rose Mini-Vista KVM.

    The Mini-Vista comes in two models, one with standard PS/2-MD6
mouse and keyboard connectors and VGA-HD15 for the monitor, and the
other with DB25 connectors at the switch for the computer ports.
Since the later required Rose proprietary cables, I chose the
former...but wound up buying Rose cables for that anyway since you
need male-male for the video hook-up which I couldn't find at Fry's.
[The Rose cables I bought are nice in that there is a single cable
that carries all of the keyboard, mouse and video, but they were a
bit pricey.]
    
    For reasons that have nothing to do with the KVM, it took a 
while to get my PWS to the point I could start DECwindows (no, the
Radeon 7500 will NOT work with a PWS 600au! :-).  When I finally
did get to the point of trying to edit in a DECterm, I found that
the "Do" key had gone AWOL and that the editing keypad keys had
been "shuffled":

		Keycap		Mapped To
		------	  	---------
		Find	  	Insert Here
		Insert Here	Find
		Remove		Select
		Select		Prev
		Prev		Remove

Oh, and the minus key, "-", on the numeric keypad, mapped to the
less-than character, "<".  F13, F14, Help, Do and F17 sent nothing
to the xev, while F18, F19 and F20 mapped to F13, F14 and Help as
viewed in xev.  Finally, the Compose key sent nothing.

    Subsequent correspondance with the three vendors, plus Avocent,
Black Box and Linksys, showed that all vendors say the support ONLY
101/102 key "standard" PC keyboards.  Except for Rose...

    The Rose technical support person found explicit referecnces to
LK461-xx in his database, one in the german language varient!  The
low-end Mini-VIsta that I purchased doesn't support the LK461, but
the more expensive ServeView Pro and UltraView Pro series of KVMs
do!  So if you have a situation where you must have full LK461
functionallity, there is at least one vendor out there who can help. 
Unfortunately, I can't afford $500US for the convenience...although
I have been keeping an eye on eBay...

    Rose support did say that there is a 1-to-1 conversion from the
scan mode 2 to scan mode 3 sequences, and so I suppose there is a
possiblity to remap the keys using xmodmap.  However, for those keys
which didn't send anything to xev, I don't know whether the VMS
DECwindows driver is even processing the codes received (Fred???).

    For the time being, I will plug in two keyboards, one into the 
switch to be used with the laptop, and one directly into the PWS.
I have enough room on either side of my desk to lean the unused
keyboard against the side of the desk. :-}

    I hope this summary helps others who are looking for a KVM that
will work with there Alpha VMS systems.

        I haven't seen this topic come up very often and it's not in any
    FAQ (that I know of).  The fact  is, it seems very difficult to find
    this  information; usually, I expect, it's in the User's manual that
    _may_ have come with the hardware (terminal), but it's  not  in  the
    VMS user's manuals, or even the I/O Reference Guide, etc.  Note that
    the  compose  sequences  are  common  to  all  VTxxx  terminals (and
    DECterms) from the VT200_Series on  up.   [I  guess that means LK201
    and LK401 keyboards, etc.]

        I _finally_ found the  compose  sequences in the Bookreader docs
    for  VXT1200  X-terminals, Table 15-4.  I've reformatted the  table,
    and omitted some  of  the  compose  sequences  for  characters  that
    normally appear on a US keyboard (e.g., <COMPOSE> + + for the number
    sign,  #).   Also,  I've omitted the dozen or so characters that you
    can only access if you're using  the  ISO Latin 1 character set; the
    sequences  I've listed are for the DEC Multinational character  set,
    although most of these are also available in ISO Latin 1.

        That should have been <COMPOSE> + + to get the number sign, #.
    <COMPOSE> A A gives, instead, the commercial at sign, @.

It generates international characters using the VT Multinational
character set (which is somewhat similar to ISO 8859/1.2).

For example, typing COMPOSE L - (three keys) sends a British Pound sign,
and COMPOSE a " (also three keys) sends an a-umlaut.

Anything you want.  It's just another function key.

No.  But you can reprogram the shifted function keys.  It takes a
special character sequence to do it -- there's no menu for it.

No.

Nope.  There's no sequence on that terminal to do that.
The VT102 was the last one I've seen with that feature.

You can program the shifted function keys, but NOT the regular UNshifted
function keys.  The DECUDK sequence does this:

	<DCS> Pc ; Pl | Ky1 / st1 ; ky2 / st2 ... <ST>

For example, to program shift-F6 as "ABCD", use:

	<ESC>P1;1|17/41424344<ESC>\

See the programmer's reference manual for more information.

|>   And, if possible, be able to use COMPOSE CHARACTER as a Meta key

Nope.  The "compose" key is for generating international characters via
multi-key sequences.  For example, "COMPOSE a '" will transmit an
a-acute character.  (International keyboards usually have dedicated
diacritic keys; the "compose" key is there to allow support of
unimplemented codes.)

This function is hardwired.

To be sure, you'll have to use the "define key" option in the set-up
menu to define this as you'd like.  As shipped (at least with V2.1
firmware) only the control function is defined, and that's as a record
seperator, not escape.  Well, at least DEC did label the key..  It
would probably been better to output an ESC instead of an RS though.

By the way, there is no specific mention of this even in the programmer
info (EK-VT510-RM) but the define key menu makes it easy to see nothing's
there as well as fixing it as you'd like.

You can define the ESC key as ESC, and then use ALT ESC to get a tilde.
If you don't have the ALT key, the COMPOSE key should do the ALT function.
You can also define the <> key to generate a tilde.

    I believe there is an LK4xx-series keyboard with the 101 key (US)
    PC layout -- the LK443.  Confirm with the folks at 1-800-DIGITAL
    before you order this, as I don't have any information specific
    to the VT1300-series terminal.  (And I have neither an LK443 nor
    a VT1300 around in order to try this combination.)

    I don't know that you're ever going to get a *sure* answer, as I
    don't know that this particular combination was ever tried -- and
    it's been a while since the VT1300 was sold.  And if you don't or
    can't get an answer, ask if you can return the LK443 keyboard for
    full credit -- should it not work for your intended application.

    (Using a PC-layout keyboard is bit painful on OpenVMS, as many of
    the applications have expectations around the numeric keypad...)

I just plugged in my trusty old LK201 and it works just fine. I know a lot of
people object to key placement, but I've gotten used to it. Otherwise, it's a
wonderful keyboard. No more sore hands!

I add the following lines to my $HOME/.xsession file:

xmodmap -e 'keysym comma = comma less'
xmodmap -e 'keysym period = period greater'
xmodmap -e 'keycode 191 = Escape'
xmodmap -e 'keycode 201 = grave asciitilde'

CTRL-[ and CTRL-3 are both documented to generate an ESC in both the
VT320 and VT420 manuals !

	at the major risk of starting a flame war, i timidly ask the
	following:

	I'm working on a Sun box with a type 5 keyboard.  i've used and prefer
	the LK-series DEC keyboards.  Many of the people arround me [and me
	too soon. *sigh*] have migrated to PC.  The keyboards feel and even
	sound cheap.  is there *any* way to be able to use

        (1) [preferred] a DEC LK-series keyboard on my Sun and later on
            the PC i'll be forced to use? [and what about the mouse?]

     or (2) change to one of the LK's when I go to the PC?

My sympathies.

The traditional DEC LK keyboards won't work on anything but DEC equipment.
However, DEC does make LK-series PC-compatible keyboards (LK-450?  I really
don't keep track of the numbers) which should work with any PC.  These are
built the same way as traditional DEC keyboards and would have the same
"feel" you are used to.  Until recently, however, they were only available
in the PC layout.  The PC layout has a slightly different numeric keypad
(I don't have one in front of me, but I think it's just a double-height {-}
key and no {,} key), different labels on the small cluster above the arrow
keys, and of course such fun things as Num Lock.

For the latest PCI-based Alphas running VMS, DEC came out with a new keyboard
which apparently has the standard PC electrical and signaling interface, but
the traditional DEC LK layout.  Theoretically, you could use this one on any
PC, though you'd probably have to write or find somewhere a keyboard
re-mapper, since the keys wouldn't match what the PC was expecting.  Probably
not a big job - but then, I'm not the one would would have to do it!

I don't know anything about the interface characteristics of the Sun type 5
keyboards.  If they follow the PC electrical standards, in theory you could
put in one of the PC-standard DEC keyboards.

  The LK250 and LK450 are PC-compatible keyboards.  They require new
  device drivers for DOS/Windows/NT use to allow them to switch between
  "DEC" mode and "PC" mode.  They have engravings for both layouts on
  them.

  The LK411 looks identical to the LK401, and is a LK450 without the
  local "DEC mode" switching functionality.  It does NOT have PC
  keyboard engravings on the keys.  I believe there are DOS/Windows
  drivers for this keyboard.

  OSF/1 and OpenVMS Alpha can use the LK450 and LK411 without a
  problem (their drivers understand the keyboards).  Any other system
  (like your Sun) is likely to support it in a limited fashion - as
  a PC keyboard (some of the keys would not work).

  They are PS2-compatible electrically, and support all of the PS2
  keyboard commands and modes.  They send "extra" key codes.

Excerpts from the OpenVMS FAQ: see    http://eisner.decus.org/vms/faq.htm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECW7.  Problem - My LK401 keyboard unexpectedly autorepeats

There are several modes of failure:

a) Pressing 2 and 3 keys at the same time causes one key to autorepeat when
   released.  Check the hardware revision level printed on the bottom of the
   keyboard.  If the revision level is C01, the keyboard firmware is broken.
   Call field service to replace the keyboard with any revision level other
   than C01.


b) Pressing certain keys is always broken.  Typical symptoms are: delete
   always causes a autorepeat, return needs to be pressed twice, etc.  This is
   frequently caused by having keys depressed while the keyboard is being
   initialized.  Pressing ^F2 several times or unplugging and replugging the
   keyboard frequently fix this problem.  There is a patch available to fix
   this problem [contact the CSC for information - a CSCPAT number will be
   included here when available. - Ed.]


c) A key that was working spontaneously stops working correctly. This may be
   either (a) or (b) or it may be bad firmware.  Ensure that you have the most
   recent firmware installed on your CPU.  An old version of the DEC 3000
   firmware had a bug that could cause this symptom.

                                        [kleinsorge@star.enet.dec.com]

------------------------------------------------------------

DECW8.  Problem - My LK411 sends the wrong keycodes or some keys are dead

Check the firmware revision on the keyboard.  Hardware revision B01 introduced
an incompatability with the device driver which causes the keyboard to not be
recognized correctly.  There is a patch available to fix this problem:
[AXPDRIV06_061] - the fix is also included in OpenVMS V6.2.  The rev A01
keyboard, and the LK450 should work without problems.

In the following, <CSI> is decimal code 155 and can be replaced by the

MISC3.  Can I reuse old keyboards, mice and monitors with a PC?

Older DIGITAL keyboards (with RJ modular jacks), older DIGITAL mice (with RJ
modular jacks, or with a DIN connector with pins in a configuration other than
the PC-standard DIN connector pin orientation), and older video monitors (with
RGB sync-on-green video signaling) all use signaling formats and/or
communications protocols that differ from the PC standards, and are neither
interchangable nor compatible with typical PC peripheral device controllers.
LK201, LK401, VSXXX, VR260, VR290, etc., are incompatible with most PC
systems.

Newer DIGITAL keyboards (with DIN plugs), newer DIGITAL mice (with PC-pin DIN
plugs), and newer video monitors (multi-synch) are often interchangeable with
`industry standard' PC systems, and can often be used with most PC peripheral
device controllers. LK461, LK471, PC7XS-CA, VRC16, VRC21, etc., are compatible
with most PC systems.

Rule of thumb: if the peripheral device component was sold for use with the
DEC 2000 (DECpc 150 AXP), an AlphaServer series, an AlphaStation series, or
more recent system, it will probably  work with a PC peripheral controller.
If the peripheral device component was sold for use with an VT420 or older
terminal, most VAX, most VAXstation, and most Alpha systems with names in the
format `DEC <four-digit-number>', it probably won't work on a PC.

Note that the above is a general guideline, and should not be read to indicate
that any particular peripheral device will or will not work in any particular
configuration, save for those specific configurations the device is explicitly
supported in.

Subject: Re: LK201 info needed

In article: <3pna6c$jq2@si-nic.hrz.uni-siegen.de>,
Michael Engel requests information on the LK201 keyboard.

The keyboard uses a four wire electrical interface that appears
as below when viewed from the end of the keyboard cable.

    +---------+
    | 1 2 3 4 |
    +--+   +--+
       +---+

1) Rxd (Data to keyboard)
2) Gnd
3) +12v
4) Txd (Data from keyboard)

The transmit and receive data signals are serial asynchronous,
RS-232 like, at 4800 baud (8 data bits and a stop bit).

Power consumption depends on the exact version you have.
The first version shipped in 1983 could draw up to 350 ma
(with all four LEDs and beeper on).  More recent CMOS versions
(like yours) use less than 100ma.

The custom chip you mention is probably the keyboard interface chip
and contains the -12v charge pump (for RS-232), the RS-232 drivers
and receivers, the LED driver, and the beeper driver.

The keyboard transmits scan codes when keys are depressed (and
released in up-down mode).  You can contact me directly for a
more detailed spec (peter.sichel@mro.mts.dec.com).

The firmware source code has not been published.

The LK201 and LK401 cannot be used on the VT510 and Dorio terminals.
These terminals were designed to work with off-the-shelf PS/2
compatible keyboards that use a radically different interface.

Good luck,

- Peter

  It may be possible to make an adapter to connect an LK201 to a
  6-pin PS/2 type connector, but there is no purchasable adapter.

  For this reason it is not possible to use an LK201 keyboard with
  a VT510 or Dorio terminal.

You need to be careful.  If you have a newer LK201 with
green LEDs, or an LK401, it should work fine.  If you have an
older LK201 such as the original keyboard that shipped with
the VT220, it's not safe.  The original LK201 could draw up to
350 mA (before CMOS was widely available).  This is more than
a telephone handset cord can safely handle.

The cord could overheat and become a fire hazard.

The keyboard connection on a VT220 is a standard RS232 link at the
logical level (with only four of the lines connected, of course).  The
terminal startup test code does a handshake with the keyboard; it sends
it a "what's out there?" message, and the keyboard (which contains an
8051 with a bunch of software) is expected to send back an appropriate ID.

You could have

 (a) a bad keyboard
 (b) a blown RS-232 interface in the terminal.

BTW, you say you tried different connection cables.  Where did you get
them from?  If you used telephone cables ... they won't work.  (A
standard telephone cable exchanges two of the wires.  A VT2xx needs a
"straight through" cable.  This is the logical equivalent of the need
for a "null modem".)

BTW, a warning:  Do *not* use a standard telephone cable to connect the
keyboard!  This has been known to cause fires.  (A VT100 cable contains
real wire.  A telephone-cable conductor is folded-over foil, and has 
significantly higher resistance.  If a short develops in the keyboard, 
the higher resistance can effectively disable safety circuitry in the VT200.
This is not just a theoretical possibility - actual fires have been
reported.)

Notice "Cursor Keys Mode" reset/set is separate from "Keypad Mode"
Numeric/Application.  Cursor Keys Mode, when set allows the four arrow keys
to send Application Function sequences instead of their usual ANSI
cursor movement sequences.  I don't know of any reason to distinguish
these anymore.  I suppose when the VT100 was introduced the ANSI
cursor key sequences were not yet widely accepted.

You can have a look at its layout with the command "dxkeycaps -kbd lk421".
After seeing the placement of the arrow keys, you might decide to ignore
this option.  Or maybe not.

On the plus side: it has an Escape key!

M7. How do I type an ESC (escape) character on a DEC keyboard?

1. Use F11 on the LK201 or LK401 (in some keyboard modes--such as VT100 mode).

2. Use Ctrl-[ (left bracket)

3. Adjust the keyboard mapping in DECterm, if that's what you're using.

4. Use dxkeycaps to produce commands for xmodmap. See the manual pages
        for details.

5. Get an LK421-AA keyboard, a North American keyboard designed for UNIX
        systems.  It has an ESC key, no caps lock, and the keypad has
        been removed so the keyboard is smaller.

  Nope, only the earlier keyboards used on the VT420 and prior. All the
  keyboards
  used on our TERMINALS since VT510 have used an industry-standard connector
  (both PC and VT style keyboards). The LK411 model keyboard has a standard
  VT layout, standard PC keyboard connector and lists for $60.

As an aside, if you do need good VT100 emulation on a PC-type
platform, I can heartily recommend either MS-DOS Kermit or
Kermit 95.  These even come with a tool that put Gold (aka PF1)
where God intended it to be!

Right.  I'm typing this on a true VT100 at this very moment, as

I would argue that a good VT100 emulator should send nothing
at all if F5 is pressed.  Numerous problems have developed
with the widespread availability of "enhanced" VT100 emulators - 
resulting in many software packages that cannot be used from
true VT100's!

It is a moot point.  There ** is no ** VT100 F5 key, so there can be no
standard "VT100" F5.

Technically, a real VT100 doesn't even have F1-F4; instead it has
PF1-PF4 on the numeric pad.  If you want more function
keys, go to a good VT220 or VT320 emulator.  Otherwise you're tying
yourself into a specific emulator product.  Unfortunately, this
is all too common a problem today...

If I had a dollar for every application I have that supposedly worked
with "VT100" terminals but actually only works with one specific
enhanced emulation of a "VT100", I'd be rich.

For some good information about terminals and emulators, use...

[    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html  ]


Even better, find someone with a real VT100 manual and only
use what's in there.  Best of all, get a real VT100 and test
your application using that.  I've got a few dozen in
my garage (with manuals... hint,hint.)

  There is NO  <F5> key on the VT100, so the whole argument is (IMNSHO)
  entirely moot.

  On a Digital VT-series terminal or terminal emulator, the <F5> key is
  one of the keys that does not (by default) send an ASCII character or
  ANSI character sequence from the terminal to the host on the VT200-series
  and later terminals.  Under device-specific circumstances, the <F5> key
  can be used to (deliberately) generate a framing error -- a deliberately-
  generated framing error is usually called a <BREAK> -- on the serial line.

  In addition to the <BREAK>, there _is_ an ANSI-defined <F5> keyboard
  sequence, and some terminals and terminal emulators have chosen to allow
  it to be (optionally) sent to the host.  (The Digital VT420 is one such
  terminal -- one can set <F5> to send the <F5> sequence ("<esc>[15~")
  function key sequence, to send a <BREAK>, or one can disable it and use
  it as a "decoration" key -- using the VT420 keyboard set-up screen.)

  If the emulator has decided to send something when <F5> is pressed, then
  it is (at least in this area) a superset of the Digital VT100.  When <F5>
  is pressed, if the emulator chooses (by default) to send something to the
  host that is not the defined <F5> sequence ("<esc>[15~") nor the <BREAK>,
  then the emulator implementation is (in my opinion) incorrect.

	--

  Here are the part numbers for the VT100 documentation.  Note that there
  were several different variations of the VT100 -- some had the Advanced
  Video Option (AVO), and there were various other options available for
  the terminal that could be stuffed into the VT100 expansion card cage.

	EK-VT100-RC   VT100 PROGRAM REFERENCE CARD
	EK-VT100-TM   VT100 TECHNICAL MANUAL
	EK-VT100-UG   VT100 USERS GUIDE

  The VT101 had fewer options:

	EK-VT101-RC   VT101 PROGRAMMING REFERENCE CARD
	EK-VT101-TM   VT101 SERIES TECHNICAL MANUAL
	EK-VT101-UG   VT101 VIDEO TERMINAL USERS GUIDE

  The VT500-series is a rather more recent terminal:

     I doubt there is a written "standard" for VT100 emulation.  The VT100 
keyboard is NOT the same as the IBM PC 101-key keyboard.  For one thing, there 
are no Fnn function keys.  Second, the keypad has 18 keys, whereas the PC has 
17.  There is no "Alt" key, though there is a "Ctrl" key.  Finally, while 
there are four arrow keys, I don't think the six keys that, on the PC, live 
above the arrow keys are found on the VT100 (they came out with the VT200 
series).

     The main problem with VT-100 emulation is how to deal with the "missing" 
keypad key.  On the VT-100, the top row of keys are the four function keys 
PF1, PF2, PF3, and PF4.  The next row has four keys, 7, 8, 9, and "-"; the 
next row of keys is 4, 5, 6, and ",";  then comes 1, 2, 3, and a double-high 
"Enter", and finally a double-wide 0 and ".".  There is no "+" key.

     Some emulations blow off the top row of the PC's keys and substitute 
F1-F4 for PF1-PF4.  Others try to stay with the "feel" of the VT100, using the 
top PC row as PF1-PF4.  Of course, this means trapping NumLock and treating it 
in a special manner ...

On DEC VT-series terminals CTRL-3 gives escape.  No, there is NO ANSI
STANDARD for these key sequences!  They are all proprietary.  (The
VT200-series, though, does form an informal standard of sorts.)

CTRL-2 gives NUL, CTRL-4 gives FS, CTRL-5 gives GS, CTRL-6 gives RS,
CTRL-7 gives RS, and CTRL-8 gives US.  These are all on DEC terminals.

That's because the VT100 didn't have function keys.  (So much for "vt100
emulation!")  F11 is ESC, F12 is BS, and F13 is LF.

yes, they do. They even come with DECs PCI based Alphastations.

they're called LK412 if memory serves. Have a look at

Currently there's a series of keyboards known variously as the LK411
and LK461.  These keyboards sport the LK401 style layout.
Theoretically, they require no drivers to function under Windows NT.

The LK411, for example functions fine when running the eXcursion X
server on systems that load the standard keyboard drivers.  I don't
have first-hand experience with KEAterm and Smarterm but I'm lead to
believe that they work with LK411 as well.

One word of warning regarding the LK411: The final release of Windows
NT 4.0 is masking out key events that are not on Industry Standard
101/102 keyboards.  4.0 beta2 and 3.51 function properly, but the
final 4.0 ignores keys like "Do" and "Help."  Microsoft is looking
into this.

 VT terminals, before the VT500 series, did not save Fkey definitions to
 non-volatile memory.  Fkeys definitions are in RAM only and are lost
 upon power off.

That combination is fine. I've just powered up that combo here, so it will
work (barring any freaky firmware revision problems).

I can't find a VT200 manual, but my VT320 manual says that to get
vertical bar (|) you should press ^ and / in that order. I've just
tried that by setting my English keyboard to French/Belgian and it
works.

  { is produced by Compose ( -
  } is produced by Compose ) -

Some of the other compose sequences are listed in

    http://www.cs.utk.edu/%7eshuford/terminal/dec_keyboards_news.txt

but this is not a definitive list (it is aimed at English keyboard users).

I don't think ALT+number to get at characters was introduced until
the VT420 (because there wasn't an ALT key before that!)

Can't help you with the Linux part of your question.

Alan,

I know this much in general.  Someone else may be able to fill you in
on more details:

1. If the keyboard layout is not a standard PC layout, odds are 99.9+%
that you'll run into some sort of glitch using it on a PC.  Not worth
the bother, IMHO.

2. The LK470-series keyboards are designed to run NT on an
AlphaStation, I believe.  DEC didn't mess up the design of
AlphaStations and other Alpha boxes too badly, attemping to use a lot
of off-the-shelf commodity components.  Every so often, an engineer,
planner, or marketing type decided that the DEC way was best (and more
expensive for the customer, who was thwarted from using inexpensive
off-the-shelf upgrades), and did something dumb to muck up a perfectly
good commodity part.  Haven't tried an LK470 keyboard yet, but my
guess is that it does not differ from one of the keyboards with a PC
part number.  I'd like to hear from someone else who has tried it, and
whether or not they succeeded.

3. Finally, I doubt very much that anyone has written Windows keyboard
drivers for LK250, LK450 or any of the other keyboards with a VMS
layout.  Even if they do exist, someone then has to own  the
responsibility of testing and qualifying them with Win 95, Win 98, Win
NT, etc, etc. 

I once worked long ago for Honeywell, another company that once
thought it was in the computer business and that the Honeywell way
was the true way.  Honeywell made an absolute mess out of trying to
provide PC keyboards and drivers that would mimic their word
processing keyboards, yet work normally with off-the-shelf apps.
This idiocy contributed to their downfall, but there were many other
equally wrong-headed decisions made along the way.  I suspect that
ex-Wang people could tell a similar story about their Wang PCs with
weird Wang keyboards.  Sorry to be so long winded.  But I want to do
my best to discourage you from committing unnatural acts with computer
keyboards.  :)

4. Not even all PC keyboards are made alike.  The older DEC PC
keyboard with the nice clicky touch will not work in a 1200 series
server, but a newer and extremely cheaply made DEC keyboard does.
Keyboards have a tiny bit of firmware in them, too, and sometimes the
keyboard may fit the physical connection, but just plain not work.
I've run into a few other odd mismatches of keyboard and system in
recent years.

        What terminal is he set to????

        Either he is NOT using VT-340-A2, or, he doesn't have it, and
        is using some default like VT-100. Have him do a:

                infocmp vt340 -or-
                infocmp vt-340........

        It will display the terminal info file in ascii.

        Another possibility is that the file is "inadequate".  By that,
        I mean, it exists, but doesn't have ALL the keys described properly.
        I've found that to be the case on a number of terminals.

There's no way to do this.  This got discussed repeatedly within the old
Terminals group at DEC when I was there.  The irresolvable problem was:
If you provide a way to disable Setup, how do you ever enable it again?
You could posit some kind of password mechanism, but what if the user
forgets the password?  We did *not* want to deal with hundreds of Field
Service calls from people who set a password and forgot it - or who had
all their terminals set to some unusable state by a disgruntled employee
(or silly high-school kid) who then set a password known only to him.
But providing a password that could be easily disabled was pointless.

What customers who were concerned about this - because they had a bunch
of VT's at a trade show, for example - usually did was to remove the
SETUP keycap - or, more elegantly, inject a bit of glue under it to keep
it from operating.  "Authorized personnel" would have access to an
unmodified keyboard which they could swap into place when required.
Sure, anyone can get hold of one - but in typical usage, this was not a
threat.  How many people walk into a trade show carrying a spare
keyboard?  (Hmm, these days one could probably program a Palm Pilot to
emulate a VT2xx keyboard....)

VT2xx keyboards are pretty cheap these days.  I'd go with the "glue"
solution myself....

I'm using LK46W-A2 on my Compaq-Linux machine (Emacs & EDT emul, i'm
really happy).

It was previously hooked to the AXP 500-au series under VMS and DUNIX.
The quality is not the same as LK401-AA on my old AXP, but the
functionality is the same. It is even usable under NT.

This has been a sticky point since the mid-1970's.  Basically DEC OS's
and terminals assume the ASCII DEL character (127) to be a "backspace",
and so have their "<--" set so.  However, many emulators followed the
convention of most every other terminal and use the ASCII BS character
(8) as the "backspace".

Since the mid-1980's, most good terminal emulator programs have offered
an option as to what character to send from the "<--" key in ANSI terminal
emulation.  Also most multi-personality terminals offered the same kind
of setup option when emulating a VT100-family terminal.

To be fully compatible, your software should expect a DEL character for
a "backspace" from a VT-100-style terminal.  If your software is running
under UNIX, you don't have to program anything different, as this is a
terminfo entry and stty option that can be changed and remapped.  In fact
I have seen two different UNIX terminfo entries available to address this
-- vt220-bs and vt220-del  Using the termlib or curses, your application
then shouldn't care.

Hi there, Ian.

AFAICR, there is no configurable option to make a VT220 send backspace
instead of delete. You have 3 choices:

1. Make the host understand what DEL means. If you're using a Unix-type
   of system, check out the 'stty' command in your manual pages. 
   If you're using something older, like CP/M, it should work OK.
2. Press Ctrl-H instead of Delete.
3. Put the terminal into VT100 mode, and use F12.

I think option 1's your best bet. >:)

The actual process of moving the cursor back one space, overtyping the 
character *under* the cursor with a space, then moving the cursor back 
one space again is all done by the host, not by the terminal, which is
why it won't do anything in Local mode (or, indeed, if you just had two
terminals hooked up together over a null-modem connector.) 
 
Good luck. VT220's are nice terminals. You could bounce rocks off 'em.

S.

15 function keys (F6-F20), in addition to an editing keypad (e.g., pageup).

vt100's PF1-PF4 are not considered by some people to be function keys
(vt220 has those also, anyway).

vt220 supports 8-bit characters, multiple fonts, has better support for
video-attributes (you can turn bold/underline off without affecting other
settings).  there's a number of other enhancements.

The space bar,left shift, compose,alt, and the minus, zero, enter on
numeric keypad.  When you push the keys they do not display on the

thats how they are grouped.

I've got one of these.  I've got a couple PC's and a couple Alpha's on
it normally.  I've not had trouble with a AlphaStation 200 4/233 running
OpenVMS that I used to have on it, but I have had trouble with the
keyboard locking up and being unusable with a Multia running OpenBSD. 
Also I just plain can't hook the Keyboard or mouse of my PWS433au up to it.

John,

You'll hate this, but, it depends.

I've cleaned keyboards from the VT220 on up to the Vt500 stuff.  The
VT500 keyboards are very simple and easy to clean.  Use whatever is
necessary to cut the dirt and grease, but normally a mild dishwashing
liquid works well.

The VT400 keyboards need a bit more care, they're more delicate.  It's
when you go back to VT320 and VT220 keyboards that you must be careful. 
Some have what looks like gold contacts that come together when you push
the key down, and the keys break rather easily.

Remember that some time ago, for environmental reasons, DEC began to
clean circuit boards with water in place of solvent. Water should not
hurt any of the components, if it dries and leaves no residue. So the
question is, what kind of water do you have?  I don't think distilled
water is necessary, but rather hard water, lots of calcium and such,
could be a problem.  Never has been an issue for me, just mentioning
possibilities.

Then there is the question of harm.  How can you hurt a keyboard that's
already useless from dirt and grease?  Just using hot water, from the
tap, not boiling, and a mild dishwashing soap can work wonders. 
Scrubbing carefully with a brush will clean up the keys really well.

Then again, I have an air compressor, and blow the water off/out after
washing and rinsing.

Dave

Political correctness.  This all started, I think, with some massive
"human factors" study commissioned by DEC in Europe, which ultimately
resulted in some Din standards and the LK (canoe paddle) keyboard.  I'm
pretty sure this was at least a year or two before the IBM 101 keyboard.
(I remember first seeing the keyboards at a nondisclosure presentation
of... I think it was the Pro 350?... and being utterly appalled.  Of
course the Pro 350 offered a wide choice of appalling features.  Didn't
DEC finally empty its warehouses of them by making them into consoles
for the VAX 8700?)

Before that was a long period of "let the 100 flowers bloom", and some
very nice keyboards appeared, such as on the Concept-100.  Back in those
days, people touch typed, and there was value in having all the keys in
striking distance of the home keys.

The DEC study was basically geared towards making computers (and
therefore keyboards) more friendly to the general non-computer-using
public, thereby increasing the market for computers and terminals.  So
as a result we had to have all these ergonomically huge Return/Enter
and Shift keys, and whatnot (though, ironically, they never thought of
a HELP key).  Implicit in the process was the recognition that (a) the
terminal-host model was dead (so we don't need Ctrl or Esc keys any
more), and (b) touch-typing was a discredited legacy concept (because
it is not a mass-market phenomenon).

The ultimate insult to the Old Guard was putting Caps Lock where Ctrl
was.  What could be more useless?  This seemed to send us directly
back to the ASR 33 Teletype days when computers spoke only upper case.
(Those of us who remember the VT50 and earlier still recall the
liberating sensation of entering and viewing lowercase on the VT52 and
early DECwriters.)

To add fuel to the fire, various European government procurement
bodies began to *require* the new layout, so by 1983 or so, the only
keyboards available were essentially today's DEC and IBM layouts.  At
least DEC waffled by leaving Ctrl in the same row, rather than moving
it way down to tendon-twisting territory.  But anyway, what it all
adds up to is: you're supposed to be using a mouse, not a keyboard.

And that's why the market for good keyboards is a vanishingly small one.

Interestingly enough, even a VT220 with german keyboard layout 
doesn't provide a pipe, you have to press <compose><shift-~><shift-7>
(which certainly is not documented on the kbd itself).

And anyway there must be a reason, that bourne shell accepts "^" for "|".

hmm - when did VT220's come out - early 80's I think.

"^" used to be up-arrow, and "|" is a relative latecomer (it's possible that
the German keyboards were originally the "same" and that their design
branched to support umlauts in preference to the newer characters such as
"|", "{" and "}".

On the German LK201, you need to press Kombizeichen followed by / and ^.

Subject: Need Verification (Correction?) of VT100 Keycodes

I am using Linux (Mandrake 8.1 with X Server 4.0, although I can bypass X 
if needed, but would prefer not to bypass it).  I'm using Minicom, which 
emulates a VT100 keyboard.

I have to write some scripts to automate interacting with another system, 
and I need to verify key codes.  I find it easy to find VT100 control codes 
for screen functions, and I've found most of the codes I need to include, 
but I am still lacking one.

This is what I have for escape sequences:

  F1 = PF1 = <ESCAPE>-O-P
  F2 = PF2 = <ESCAPE>-O-Q
  F3 = PF3 = <ESCAPE>-O-R
  F4 = PF4 = <ESCAPE>-O-S

 NUMERIC KEYPAD ENTER = <ESCAPE>-O-M

These I've verified by using the actual key sequences in place of the keys. 
 I have not been able to verify, but believe the following to be correct:


   UP ARROW = <ESCAPE>-O-A
 DOWN ARROW = <ESCAPE>-O-B
RIGHT ARROW = <ESCAPE>-O-C
 LEFT ARROW = <ESCAPE>-O-D

Are these correct?

And the last one I cannot find ANY documentation on is <CONTROL>-<ENTER> 
(the system I login to refers to this as "the ENTER key above the SHIFT 
key").  Just a plain <ENTER> does not work, it has to be with the CONTROL key.

I am assuming the TAB key is a standard ASCII 09, but if it isn't, I need 
to find that as well.

Can anyone confirm the arrow and tab key codes and tell me what the 
<CONTROL>-<ENTER> code would be?

Any help is appreciated!

Hal

This had me scratching my head. You could be right, although the
description of its position doesn't quite match the real keyboard[1].

The Enter key is actually on the numeric keypad. If the OP is actually
referring to the Return key, then that doesn't change its code when used
with Control, IIRC.

Subject: VT420 position-mode keyboard reports

I have connected a VT420 to my Debian GNU/Linux box.  I would
like to use a Finnish keymap on the VT420, but the one it has is
rather different from what I'm used to.  AFAIK it is not possible
to edit the keymap in the terminal itself without hacking ROMs,
but I think I could set the terminal to send key position codes
(DECKPM) instead of characters, and then make the host translate
the positions to characters per any imaginable keymap.

For this, I need to know the format of the key position reports.
Here is what I have found:

* Each key has a three-character code, denoted <key> below.  The
  first character is a letter between 41h (A) and 47h (G), and
  the last two characters are digits.

    G99G00G01G02G03  G05G06G07G08G09  G11G12G13G14 G15G16--- G20G21G22G23

      E00E01E02E03E04E05E06E07E08E09E10E11E12E13-  E16E17E18 E20E21E22E23
      D00-D01D02D03D04D05D06D07D08D09D10D11D12 ||| D16D17D18 D20D21D22D23
    C99C00-C01C02C03C04C05C06C07C08C09C10C11C12C13    C17    C20C21C22C23
    B99---B00B01B02B03B04B05B06B07B08B09B10B11---  B16B17B18 B20B21B22|||
         A00-A01-A02-------------------A09-A10-              A20---A22A23
  
* The following keys are modifiers:

    <key>  bits  name
    -----  ----  ----
    B99    01    Left Shift
    B11    02    Right Shift
    C00    04    Lock
    C99    08    Ctrl
    A01    10    Left Alt
    A09    20    Right Alt
    A00    40    Left Compose
    A10    80    Right Compose

  <modifiers> is a string of two upper-case hexadecimal digits
  that indicates which modifier keys I am pressing.  For example,
  if I were pressing Lock and Ctrl, <modifiers> would be 30h 43h
  ("0C").  It does not matter whether Lock is currently on, only
  whether I am pressing it.

* The terminal sends the following reports:

    ESC 5Ch
      This means a modifier key has gone up or down.
      This means a modifier key has gone up or down.
      The terminal never sends this twice in a row.

    ESC 5Fh 3Ah <key> <modifiers>
      A key was pressed, and the modifiers differ from the
      previous keypress.  If <key> is itself a modifier, then
      <modifiers> include it.

    2Fh <key>
      A key was pressed, and the modifiers are the same as last time.

    2Eh
      The same key was pressed again, with the same modifiers.

* For example:

    ESC 5Ch ESC 5Fh 3Ah "B99" "01"
      I press and hold Left Shift.

    2Fh "D04"
      I press R.

    2Eh
      I press R again.

    ESC 5Ch ESC 5Fh 3Ah "C00" "05".
      I press and hold Lock.

    2Fh "A02"
      I press Space.

    ESC 5Ch
      I release Lock.  The terminal does not report which
      modifier key I release.

    ESC 5Fh 3Ah "C07" "01"
      I press J.  The terminal reports I'm still holding Shift.

    ESC 5Ch ESC 5Fh 3Ah "A09" "21"
      I press and hold Right Alt.

    ESC 5Ch
      I release Right Alt, then Shift.  The terminal reports ESC
      5Ch only once.

    ESC 5Fh 3Ah "D10" "00"
      I press P.  The terminal reports I have released all modifiers.
      The Lock indicator is still lit, but I am not pressing the key
      and that is all that matters.

Is this a complete description of key position reports?
It seems to be, but I once wrote a terminal emulator to match
some terminal descriptions, and when I eventually found ECMA-48,
I saw that I had written the control sequence parser all wrong.
I would rather not make such mistakes this time.

In particular, I don't see why the terminal sends ESC 5Ch without
telling the host which modifier key was released, nor why ESC 5Fh
is always followed by a redundant 3Ah.

I haven't seen a specification for Key Position Mode. Even the VT500-Series 
Programmer References don't describe it. I made some notes a few years ago 
which I have just checked against yours. I think you've got it mostly 
right, so I have just put a few more notes below.

These are key coordinates based on ISO 9995, which defines keyboard 
layouts. This standard isn't available freely on the Web, AFAIK.

You started at the end! I think it is more helpful to see this conversation 
as a set of packets which start with ESC 5Fh and end with ESC 5Ch, which 
I'm going to refer to by their names: APC and ST.

APC is a code that starts one of the kinds of control string defined by 
ECMA-48. All of these control strings end with ST. If you send APC _to_ a 
DEC VT, it'll do nothing with most[1] other codes you send, until it sees 
ST.

[1] I'm simplifying slightly. For the full story, see 
http://vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser

Although Key Position Mode is the only mode in which the VT will send an 
APC...ST string, DEC always seemed to make their private codes extendable, 
giving themselves room for manoeuvre with later models. I think this is why 
APC is followed by ':' (3Ah) in these sequences. If it was followed by any 
other code, it would mean something else.

If you put the VT into KPM and press a non-modifier key first, you won't 
see a leading ST. You'll see APC : followed by the code of the key you 
pressed, and the modifier code 00. You can press as many non-modifier keys 
as you like from now on, and you won't see an ST code. You'll only see an 
ST when the modifier state changes. So, a complete packet from APC to ST is 
a set of keys with the same modifier state.

If you press or release a modifier key, that packet finishes, so the VT 
generates ST. If you had two modifier keys depressed and you release one, 
the terminal knows that any further non-modifier keys would require a new 
packet, so it generates the ST. When the second modifier key is released, 
the terminal thinks that there is no point sending a second ST, because it 
is really only interested in keys being pressed, not released.

I'll try to explain that last sentence a bit better. This mode isn't trying 
to duplicate a PC's view of its keyboard, where every key transition (press 
and release) is available. It is only trying to provide a more flexible 
mechanism of showing key presses. However, the modifier keys complicate the 
issue because they are doing double duty. The terminal wants to tell you 
when they are pressed, as with non-modifier keys, but it also wants to tell 
you about the overall modifier state.

So, the reason for starting new packets is this: a new key has been pressed 
AND the modifier state has changed. So, let us walk through an example 
sequence: SHIFT pressed, CTRL pressed, A pressed, A released, SHIFT 
released, CTRL released. In the table below, spaces are just for clarity; 
they don't feature in the sequences.

SHIFT pressed      APC : B99 01
CTRL pressed       ST APC : C99 09
A pressed          /C01
A released                 (nothing)
SHIFT released     ST
CTRL released              (nothing)

Firstly, when (left) SHIFT is pressed, a new packet has to start. This 
tells us that SHIFT has been pressed and that the modifier for any other 
keys is SHIFT.

Then CTRL is pressed. Well, this is a new key and a modifier, so a new 
packet is required. The old one is ended with ST, and a new packet is 
started, which tells us that CTRL has been pressed, and the modifiers for 
any future keys are CTRL+SHIFT.

Now A is pressed. As it isn't a modifier, it simply adds its code to the 
already-open packet. When it is released, there is no new information, so 
no codes are sent.

However, when SHIFT is released, the terminal knows that the packet has 
come to an end, because it doesn't matter whether a modifier key or non-
modifier key is pressed next -- the new modification state (caused by the 
release of SHIFT) will have to be reported in a new packet. So, the 
terminal just closes the packet with ST. It can't start a new packet yet, 
to report the new modifier state, because it a new key must be pressed to 
start a new packet.

Finally, when CTRL is released, no code is output because there is no new 
information.

Both correct.

>       I press and hold Left Shift.

The initial ST here is redundant. If the first key you press on entering 
KPM is a modifier, ST is generated, for no good reason. If the first key is 
a non-modifier, it isn't generated (ie. the first code you see will be 
APC). I can't explain this, but it doesn't matter. On reception by the 
terminal, ST doesn't do anything other than change reset the parser to 
ground state, so you can send as many STs in a row as you like, and they 
are completely harmless.

I hope I've covered those to your satisfaction, above.

Hmm ... so much for this being a "few notes"!

Thanks!  This means the filter can just pass characters through
if they are not inside an APC...ST packet.

The VT420 can actually send APC and ST as 8-bit controls, too.

So, if my filter receives APC followed by something other than
':', it should ignore (but possibly pass through) everything
until it gets ST.

Can I get the remaining information with some other command?
I would like to know whether the terminal thinks Lock is on,
because it has the indicators.

(On the other hand, sending such a command would require the
filter to detect control sequences sent to the terminal as well,
so that it would know where to insert its own.  This would enable
a new set of bugs.)

I can't reproduce this now.  I turned the VT420 on, enabled KPM
via setup, and pressed and released Left Shift.  The VT420 sent
APC : B99 01 ST; there was no initial ST.

Subject: Redefining/copying VT520 caps lock & print screen keys

Hi all,

I have problem with a truncated 60 key space saver PC keyboard that I want
to use with a VT520 serial terminal, which can use a PC style PS/2
keyboard.

This small keyboard does not have a caps lock or print screen key, which
is a problem, because I would like to use this keyboard to access the set
up menus for the VT520. Apparently, the only way to to get the terminal
setup menus to come up is to hit <caps lock> + <print screen> on a regular
104 key PC keyboard, according to the terminal manual.

FYI, here's an image of the keys on the space saver keyboard:
http://shop.store.yahoo.com/pfuca-store/

My idea was to remap a couple of unused keys to caps lock and print
screen, using an old PC 104 key keyboard I had laying around, install the
smaller keyboard on the terminal and then (hopefully) be able to access
the setup menus using the keys redefined in the terminal's define key
editor.

This doesn't work, at least using the copy key method outlined in the
terminal manual for the F1 and F2 keys that I copied the caps lock and
print screen keys to, using the VT520's define key editor. I copied the
caps lock key to the F1 key and print screen to the F2 key using the
define keys menu and the 104 key keyboard.

I saved the keys and the terminal settings, got out of the setup menus and
powered down the terminal. Then I installed the smaller keyboard and tried
pressing the F1 and F2 keys at the same time. The terminal status bar
shows the text "Lock" below the reverse video bar at the bottom of the
terminal screen, but the terminal setup menus do not come up.

I have tried this method for other meta keys, like the escape key, and
also a couple of alphanumeric keys in desperation, like "q" and "w" but
nothing works using the small keyboard.

Am I using the right method here? Is this even possible, if my keyboard
does not have the caps lock and print screen keys installed? 

Thanking you,

Or Alt+Print Screen. Or F3, if that is the very first key pressed on power up.

This doesn't work because you don't actually want to move Caps Lock and 
Print Screen functionality to other keys; you want to map Set-Up onto one 
of them.

Let's say you want to use Ctrl+Esc to go into Set-Up.

Hook up your little keyboard, turn on the terminal and go into the Define 
Key screen, and press Esc (by itself) as the key to be defined. The line 
below the key number will show that this is already a function key rather 
than alphanumeric, so this key will let us assign built-in terminal 
functions to it. If you pick a key that isn't already a function key (such 
as "Q"), you can turn it into one, but you lose its normal ability to send 
characters.

Now go down the list of definitions to the line marked "Control". This 
shows that Ctrl+Esc will still generate ESC by default. Move right into the 
box that contains a list of terminal functions and select Set-Up. Hit "OK" 
and exit Set-Up.

You'll now find that Ctrl+Esc will take you into Set-Up.

If you hook up your 104-key keyboard, go into Define Key and press Print 
Screen as the key to be defined, you'll see why Alt+Print Screen does what 
it does. The Caps Lock+Print Screen behaviour isn't defined this 
way (because Caps Lock isn't a modifier key); it is just hard-wired into 
the terminal.

Cool. My VT520 manual does not mention these as possibilities for the PC
keyboard.

Woohoo! Thanks a lot, that works fine.

This is really great, because I am constrained on space and was afraid I
would have to use the battleship-sized PC 104 keyboard if I ever had to
redefine any terminal settings. Also, I'm fond of my little PFU keyboard.

Are there any VT520 (or DEC/Boundless) terminal documentation resources on
the net that you can recommend? I found a VT520 programmer's reference at
vt100.net:

    http://vt100.net/docs/vt520-rm/

Thanks again,

I'm afraid not. You will need to use a keyboard with a PS/2 interface
such as the LK461-AG. You should be able to use a standard PC keyboard
if you're not too bothered about staying with a classic DEC layout.

VT520s will accept a standard PS/2-style PC keyboard, though the layout
is a bit funky compared to a real LK keyboard and what you might expect
as regards the "Setup" key and such.

Subject: VT420 keyboards

Hi,

   The VT220 that I've used as my operator console for
almost 10 years seems to have half kicked the bucket.
The screen characters went bad.  When I power cycled,
the screen never came back (though the power light
is still on) and the keyboard lights blink about once
every second.  I'm thinking of getting a VT420 and
I'm wondering if I can keep my same LK201 keyboard
or if it will only take an LK4xx series.

The LK201 works fine on a VT420.  The blinking
lights on the keyboard can be an indication of
keyboard problems, so don't assume that just
the VT220 went south.

If the LK201 is bad, I look at it as one of two
major problems.  The keyboard has gotten
some gunk down inside and fouled up the
key matrix or the logic board has gone bad.
Usually it is the matrix and the LK201 is
difficult to clean.  I have yet to see the logic
board go bad.  I have a few spare logic boards
if that turns out to be the case for yours and
you want to replace it.

Subject: Trouble with VT420 cursor keys under SuSE LINUX

Hello ev'rybody,

I have just purchased a DEC VT420 terminal with a German LK401 keyboard for 
use as a second console with my LINUX (SuSE 8.2) PC via RS232C null modem 
connection. Everything works fine --- only the keys of the editing keypad 
(especially the cursor keys) and PF1 thru PF4 don't work.

When I set the "Arrow Keys" to "Normal" in the VT setup and push one of the 
arrow keys when I'm inside the LINUX shell (bash), the cursor escapes its 
position (into the previous line, for instance). Then I must press 
[Ctrl]+[U] to be able to issue shell commands again.

If the "Arrow Keys" are set to "Application", the arrow keys start printing 
characters like 'À' on the screen, and the PFs do the same (even if the 
chars are not the same).

My terminal works in VT400 mode with 8 bit chars, and the agetty program on 
the PC is set to "vt420f". I also tried "vt400", "vt420" etc, - but the 
results were the same. I updated the terminfo database (ver. 5.3): This 
worked for exactly one VT session - but now I have the problems with the 
cursor keys again. :-(

By the way, many screen-oriented programs like mc or texconfig display 
nonsense on my VT. Can anybody help me?!?!

Thanx in advance

Well --- I supposed I have solved the problem on my own: In the setup menu 
"General", choose "VT 400 Mode; 7-bit Controls". Still I can't figure out 
why the VT420 uses 8 bit characters and 7 bit control sequences --- but it 
works. :-))

Have a nice day!

If you have access to a VMS system, look at SYS$SYSTEM:SMGTERMS.TXT.
There in, you'll find descriptions of the escape sequence transmitted by
the active function keys. (Roughly equivalent to the termcap file in
UN*X-land, but must be "compiled" into TERMTABLE.EXE.)

Note, however, that the following keys are local to the terminal and
send nothing to the host:

F1 (No Scroll or Scroll Lock) is an XOF/XON toggle.

F2 (Print Screen) sends a text form of what's on the screen to the
printer port. CTRL+F2 toggles "Auto-Print" (what comes the screen also
goes to the printer port).

F3 (Setup) Enter Set up mode. Is a toggle.

F4 (Switch Session or Talk/Data) on VT200 and VT300, was intended for
use with an available internal modem (I think). On VT420 and VT500,
either triggers session control software or switches locally between
pre-configured sessions (for example: Session 1: Comm-1, Session-2:
Comm-2, Session-3: Comm-3).

F5 (Break) generates a break on the currently selected serial port.
