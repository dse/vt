Doug Engelbart Discusses Mouse Alternatives
</H2>

<I>
<P>
Beginning in the late 1970s, the ARPAnet connected together the 
scientists and engineers who were working on some new ideas
that eventually congealed into the Internet and the GUI user
interface which, by the end of the Twentieth Century, had become ubiquitous.
(These things were invented neither by Microsoft nor by Al Gore.)
</P>

<P>
One ARPAnet discussion forum was the "WorkS" electronic mailing
list, in which participants hashed out design criteria for
personal computerized workstations that were intended to
increase productivity of knowledge workers.

One message posted to WorkS in 1984 was from Douglas Engelbart,
who while working at Stanford Research Institute had invented
the computer mouse.  He related the alternative schemes for pointing
and clicking that he and his research group had examined.

At SRI in the 1960s we did some experimenting with a foot mouse.
I found that it was workable, but my control wasn't very fine
and my leg tended to cramp from the unusual posture and task.
I assume that these would be overcome eventually by practice.
</P>

<P>
I got to thinking about skill development with fine foot control,
and realized that most of us developed a very high degree of fine
control with the accelerator pedal.  I tried controlling vertical
cursor position with such a pedal, and it worked quite well. 
Thinking about concurrent horizontal control, I realized that I
can swing my knee from side to side with fairly good control (in
terms of fraction of the total range of swing).  That worked
fairly well, better, I found, than with the foot mouse.
</P>

<P>
Then I migrated the vertical actuator from the floor pedal to 
an up-down bar actuated by the knee--which, I reasoned, was 
controlled by foot/ankle actions against the immovable floor
(to raise or lower the knee) that would be essentially the same
as when using a pedal.  So we had a compound pair of actuators
operated by a knee--up and down for vertical cursor control,
right and left for horizontal.  It was natural to learn, and
gave better control immediately than did the foot mouse (I
believe we called the latter our "skate"), but I tended to get
leg cramps from this as well as the skate.
</P>

<P>
About that time I also rigged up a mechanism that utilized a
lightweight helmet for the user to wear: turning his head from
side to side would move the cursor horizontally, and nodding
the head up and down would move the cursor vertically.  This
looked a bit strange, but it worked.  AND this also gave me
cramps, in the neck, after ten minutes or so.
</P>

<P>
I don't think that our experiences would be enough to discard
any of these possibilities from a list of research candidates.
The cramping I think would pass as skill developed, and the
degree of control achievable has to be judged after more 
practice than we gave ourselves.
</P>

<P>
The hand mouse didn't have these early problems, and gave good
results with considerably less practice than these devices
seemed to require to get past the cramping stage.
</P>

<P>
We thought about eye control, but at the time didn't want to
spend the money to implement it.
</P>

<P>
We had many things, at other levels and domains of an
"augmentation system" that I wanted to explore, besides the
best means for concurrent screen-selection and character-entry
operation.  We finally settled for the mouse in one hand and
the chord keyset in the other--and went on with other system
pursuits.
</P>

<P>
I have no particular conviction that the hand-controlled mouse
will be the best screen-select control means that will emerge;
and I applaud any pursuit of better means.
</P>

<P>
I assume that the end objective is for best overall, concurrent
control and input means.  Perhaps a combination of eye pointing,
hand controls (including character input), and coded-voice input
might be the winner--or even more parallel motor channels?  Any
such system would have to be evaluated for a specific working
context, though.  
For instance, what is best would depend upon such things as
the level of user training assumed, the responsiveness of the
system, how much concurrency can be harnessed in simultaneous
task pursuit by the system, the range of media being handled
(e.g., text, graphics, color, dynamics, voice, video frames,
people-intercom control...), etc.

Note how this forward-thinking researcher was
already anticipating the widespread use of the technologies of 
QuickTime, MPEG, RealPlayer, CU-SeeMe, NetMeeting, etc.--in a message sent
out only 4 months after Apple Computer unveiled the first Macintosh!
