The above is an excellent point.  I think it's obvious, but a lot of
PC oriented gurus don't realize how hard it is to scale stuff up.  One
wrong mouse click and a PC is mis-configured and out of sync with the
others, causing confusion with novice or non-technical users.  Responding
that "well, the users ought to be technically proficient" is not an
answer.  They didn't need to be with a dumb terminal.

"Dumb terminals" appear to be very much out of fashion.  I was expanding
a mainframe application to new users and recommend simple cheap terminals
for them (I think they're about $700 now.)  That's all they needed to do
their jobs.  They rejected that in favor of full powered PCs, loaded with
software--about $2,500 for the PC and software, plus $250 for the 3270
emulation card and software, plus installing the emulator cards and software
on the PCs.  3270 type terminals plug and go.  As far as I know, the users
never took advantage of the PC or its software (Excell, Word, etc.)



> What kinda thought processes are going on?  My organization is actually

Given all the ads in the trade press for this sort of stuff, or tools to
lock out and monitor PCs tightly, I wonder too what's the deal.  I think
it's just because PCs are in fashion, as opposed to what they can do for
a user.  Most people I know who do word processing would do fine with an
early simple W/P, like IBM's Writing Assistant.  M/S Word is very nice and
fun to play with, but I don't need to adjust font sizes and set up a
table to tell my boss which week I'm taking for vacation and where I can
be reached in an emergency.  At home, I don't need to write to the phone
company about an incorrect charge.

I'm glad I don't work for that company.

Simply incredible.  Every day I hear Bill Gates accumulated another billion.
Now I see why.  The man's a genuis, I give him credit.  He's convinced each
and every one of us we MUST have a powerful PC with Windows and current
Windows software.  

Most of us could get along with DOS 3.3, but that would be boring.
Of course, we could all drive Chevy Novas or VW Beetles, but that would
be boring too.

Gates learned well from the auto industry.

Having followed this thread for a while I thought I'd post a
contribution :-

Mainframe - The ICL 3980 in my computer room is an excellent example of
a mainframe. It can support over 800 concurrent interactive users at one
time each one getting sub second response times from the system
(depending on the applications system software), it runs a significant
batch workload at the same time.
The hardware is ultra reliable. I know of systems which have run 24
hours a day for several years without any downtime. It is self
monitoring - a system within it looks for problems and warns the
engineer if preventative maintenance is needed. The hardware is mostly
unique to ICL using custom chips and other components. It can support
huge disc arrays. Each node (a sort of CPU) is connected to its
peripherals by a high speed fibre optic token ring and nodes can be
separated by some kilometers. Adding more nodes to a system increases
its power and the OS can support either multi or single node processing.

(My first VME mainframe was a 2957 which ran a 250 user system plus the
Operating system and a development user in 8 MBytes of store)


The Operating System is similarly robust and also unique to ICL. It is
called VME and is written in a 3 GL rather than assembler. It is
flexible and easy to use. A crash in one Virtual Machine will seldom
crash the system. I have known it to run for months without a crash or a
systems re-load. Later versions support Open Systems but alas we cannot
run them on our 9 year old hardware. There is a fairly limited range of
applications packages available so we write our own using COBOL and
IDMS, C, FORTRAN and other languages are available as are some RDBMS.
The software is leased rather than purchased. The comms software can
connect, via an ethernet to dumb terminals, PCs and just about anything
you may wish to connect to. There are sophisticated performance
monitoring tools available. The manufacturers support service is very
good - in the past I have spoken to the development staff to resolve
issues - try doing that with Microsoft. Backup and recovery systems for
discs and file systems are part of the OS and work well.

Whilst the hardware and software is very costly the support costs are
very low due to the reliability of the software and hardware - I guess
that two people full time is all it takes. 

Minicomputers seem to be called servers now. I believe that any computer
attached to a network which can deliver a service to another is a
server. So my mainframe qualifies. However ignoring that. The servers we
use are based on hardware available from a number of sources. The CPUs
are either Intel or Sparc, they run UNIX or Windows NT, we buy them from
a number of vendors depending mostly on price. They tend to run packages
for Office Automation, for example MS Office and any applications run on
RDBMS such as Oracle and are written in Visual Basic or the package
equvalent. Whilst the cost of buying these beasts is low the ownership
costs are high. I guess we have 30 or so and require 5 or 6 people to
support them. Systems integration issues are always a problem. The
systems crash fairly frequently although we do push the hardware quite
hard. Lots of GPFs and ill behaved software. Diagnostic information,
especially on the NT Systems is poor at the best, still a re-load cures
most problems - shame about the other users of the system. The software
is purchased rather than leased, support when available, is poor.
Hardware problems are fairly frequent. Users tend to want the latest
version of software which means that we are constantly involved in
purchasing, testing, de-bugging , implementing and training. Performance
can be dismal when more than a few people are using the system for
complex tasks.

On the positive side they allow our users access to software using a
Windows GUI which they much prefer to the dumb terminal stuff they use
to get. We still run some UNIPLEX for those who wish to use it. Also
implementing intranets, E mail and anything involving the non-trivial
use of graphics would be impossible using the mainframe and PCs alone.

I guess that we are all familiar with single user PCs - the P200 on my
desk has a far higher MIPS rating than the 3980 but I know which one I
would use to deliver services to the 500 users we have. Slightly off
topic is my preference for the MAC plus I used as a terminal/OA machine
12 years ago. The GUI and packages were simpler and more usable that
Windows 95 and networking the beast was simplicity itself.

Every time I ask a PC hardware or software company rep why they don't have
certain features, I invariably get an answer like "Give us a break - PCs
haven't been around that long."

My response?  Competent people have. Why do you refuse to hire them? 

I usually get a blank stare in return.

There are even times when the companys' reps haven't the slightest idea
what the features are.

This is quite impressive, though we have a couple of minicomputers (or are
they micros? They're Alpha-based) that support 100 X-based users with
response times that are as good as a local PC, along with significant
amounts of software development and database activity. The state of the
art has advanced somewhat, and minicomputers are breathing hard on the
low end of the mainframe's range.

I wouldn't expect a mini to equal the workload of a big mainframe based
installation, like an airline ticketing system, but I suspect that there's
a lot of mainframes in use in smaller installations that aren't really
justifiable any more.

>The hardware is ultra reliable. I know of systems which have run 24
>hours a day for several years without any downtime.

Again, the state of the art has improved. I have PCs with uptimes in the
2 year range. There are redundant minis you can get with hot-swappable
CPUs and peripherals that shoudl have no trouble meeting this target at
a significantly lower cost.

Nine years ago you probably wouldn't have any alternative, but today you
would probably want to look at minicomputers as viable alternatives if
you were starting fresh.

The servers you're describing sound more like micros than minis. While there
are some very powerful Sparc-based systems they're on the low end of RISC
hardware and the complexity of Solaris works against them. Sun's move from
SunOS to Solaris might have been a good marketing move, but technically it's
been a disaster.

The less said about NT the better. Our NT boxes are mainly used as cheap
X terminals that happen to run Microsoft Office and Netscape locally. The
twenty or so NT boxes take up more of my time than all the X-terminals put
together. The minis (older futurebus-based Alphas running Digital UNIX)
are largely in a fire-and-forget mode.

I'm not sure if ICL ate Lyons (Lyons Electronic Office = LEO) but ICL,
in turn, ate Ferranti, Intenational Computers and Tabulators before it
did the current deal with Fujitsu. Many of us old timers - well 20 years
in IT from programmer through to Assistant Director - consider ICL
Mainframes to be much superior to other brands - notably IBM. Most of
this is down to the VME Operating System, much easier to use and manage
than OS/VS1 and MVS. Alas, to the best of my knowledge, a cupcake maker
never did feature in their list of peripherals. However the previous
model the 1900 Series did have a cullinary use :-

Cast your minds back to the early 1970s, flared trousers were still
fashionable, the Greatful Dead played the Bickershaw Festival in the UK,
Punk was in its infancy. Computers were kept in huge, air conditioned
rooms with at least one glass display wall so that visiting Important
People could be shown the prestigous machine. The ICL 1900 series was in
use throughout the UK as a General Purpose mainframe. In common with
others of the time it used core store for memory which generated a fair
amount of heat.

An unnamed Government computer installation which had recently installed
such a beast at huge expense together with a state of the art, bespoke,
real time Transaction Processing System. A party of VIPs was being shown
round by a serious suit who "knew a bit" about electronics. Having
emphasised how much the project and Mainframe had cost he mentioned that
the machine used core store. "Can we see the core store" said a visitor.
"No problem" said the suit. They walked into the Computer Room. The suit
took the back off of the cabinet which housed the store. Unbeknown to
him the Operators had put their Pie and Chips Lunches on top of the
store to keep warm. "Must be the most expensive Hostess Trolley in the
world"* said a VIP. Visitors ROTFL, Operators flee, Suit with much egg
on face.

* A Hostess Trolley was very popular at the time for keeping food warm
at dinner parties - like Flared trousers they seem to have dropped out
of fashion.

There are people who think computers are mainly tools to accomplish
some  task, something to do with manipulating and storing vast
quantities of electronic representations of something in the REAL
world. 

There are others who couldn't care less what's behind the data they're
storing and manipulating.....or whether their computers even work
reliably. For them, the line separating reality from fantasy doesn't
even exist. They use a computer for entertainment, and to play games.

Mainframes were/are used to play games sometimes, but it's probable that
upwards of 90% of what they did was WORK..... and often for profit.

'personal computers' probably are used to play games, access 'adult'
electronic sites, and feed their operators fantasies 90% of the time.

> The situation is changing all the time, but I believe there will

One would hope so. The coming revolution in personal computers will
probably involve some sort of virtual reality......which simply means
the difference between real and electronically created blurs further.

> irrespective of whether the machine is at home or on the corporate
> desktop. Whether a PC server will achieve mainframe performance and

Since they are, in the main, put to different USES by their owners, the
question is moot.....

But it's apparent that PERSONAL USE is driving the evolution of the
hardware.....selling millions of each new round of product. No reason
non-entertainment users can't benefit from $200 multi-gigabyte hard
drives, $50 for a hundred million bits of storage, $100 for 100,000
bits per second modems, etc...... it's driven the cost of computers
capable of doing real work down by several orders of magnitude.

But don't confuse what traditionally was meant by "mainframe computer" 
with what today is meant by "personal computer". The uses are different.

What we need is word or words to differentiate computers based on the
use to which they are put. "workstation" doesn't satisfy many.

Maybe we need "playstations" in our vocabulary, too.

For now, personal computers are a marketing failure, if counting
homes equipped with one is the measure. While telephones, radios,
vcr's, bathtubs, washing machines, toasters, automobiles all exceed
70%, some over 90%, of homes, personal computers are under 40%.

More people have decided to do WITHOUT, than WITH.

What it will take to 'succeed' isn't here yet, or people would be
buying them. So a 'revolution' is inevitable.

This post comes close to identifying the real issues surrounding the title 
of the thread: why mainframes? Few seem to be aware that the ratio of 
CPU speed to I/O speed was more than 1000 to 1. So the game was to 
use all those wasted CPU cycles while waiting for ANY peripheral to do 
its thing. Philco had the Transac 2000 that was able to do all I/O to and 
from mag tape, and have all other secondary transfers off-line. This 
meant tape transports received card data and output to the printer and 
punch. This was 1961. Burroughs and Honeywell had multi-processors 
and multi-I/Oprocessors, which allowed many I/O's to occur concurrently 
and then to set a flag to tell the control progam that the I/O was done. 

The 1401 did increase I/O speed, but without multiple processes to use 
the wasted CPU power there was still a huge amount of time that the 
CPU sat idle. So the real reason for mainframes was that you could have 
hundreds of peripheral devices on-line concurrently, and tasking for 
transaction oriented applications. It was the ability to create program 
modules that could handle a variable load of on-line tasks, with security, 
breakout/restart/recovery, audit/load-management, and a host of other 
functions all in a single environment. The need still exists.

I am not sure of the numbers, but that would be TPF (Transaction 
Processing Facility) on large IBM iron.  TPF is the modern name 
for it - anyone who has been around for a while would call it ACP
for Airline Control Program, because as you mention, what it did 
(and still does) is reservation systems.

TPF/ACP is a real story - it is a complete throwback, people here
on this list who are old timers would feel right at home in it (of
course, after 5 minutes you should start cursing the old IBM 
360/370 artifacts, but I digress ;-)

In fact, anyone who grew up with unix, relational databases, and 
modern operating systems of any kind (not to mention real languages)
might not even recognize ACP stuff as code - this is the real deal, 
the real throwback to ancient times.  The real code-bummed, bit-
aligned, side-effect-code, 2k address blocked, put everything 
exactly where you want it, where will the heads on the disk be 
as we are executing *this* routine, custom nitro-fueled funnycar
of a system, with only one purpose in life to get from here to 
there as fast as you can and if it takes a support team of 
thousands and costs millions of dollars that is small beans...

Seriously, things have gotten a *little* more modern from what I 
am told (I know a few TPF programmers who work for amtrak, marriott, 
and other places) but this is computing the old fashioned way.

Oh yeah, one other thing.  Modern stuff can't TOUCH this performance.
Relational Data Bases are a joke compared to this.  They work on a
different time base compared to this.  It is, in a strange way, very
satisfying to see this solidly 1970s stuff blow the doors off of
the new stuff.  It won't last forever, but it has lasted a LONG time.

Yep.  It is a different world.

PC performance has historically outperformed mainframes of one or two
decades earlier, but mainframe technology doesn't stand still either. 
No doubt PC servers 10 years down the road will rival or surpass
mainframes of today, but not the new mainframes of that day.  One of the
surprising results of past infatuations with C/S and workstations is the
the total MIP's in mainframes has continued to increase, and recently
the total number of systems has started to increase again as well.

I've seen win95 bluescreen without any apps up. It just's as unstable as
system 7
