<P>
<B>Forklift upgrade</B>: <I>N.</I> --
An "upgrade" from one computer generation or product line to a
succeeding generation, version, or product line, which requires that
all or nearly all of the hardware be removed and replaced with a
completely new set of hardware components. (<I>As if to put a forklift
under the computer's chassis and carry it away.</I>)

<BR>
<BR>
(From a hardware point of view, there is little to distinguish a
<I>forklift upgrade</I> from a wholesale replacement of the whole system,
although from a software point of view there may be continuity.)

<P>
<B>In-cabinet upgrade</B>: <I>N.</I> --
An upgrade from one computer generation or product line to a
succeeding generation, version, or product line, in which the key
hardware components that yield presumably higher performance have been
made to work in concert with some of the old parts, such that a
significant portion of the old hardware components remain at the
completion of the upgrade.

<BR>

(Such an
upgrade  might consist of replacing a processor circuit board or chip
while keeping the old memory system, chassis, and peripherals.)
