News and discussion of keyboards connected to workstations running Unix

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

A Frequently Asked Question about Unix keyboard use, at least from
new users, is regarding the keys and functions known as "Backspace",
"Erase", "Delete", and "DEL", and/or "Rubout".  

One reason for this frequency is that the formal "de jure" X3.4 ASCII 
standard differs from "de facto" common practice in the Unix community.

Many Unix users configure their keyboards such that the "Backspace" key
in the upper-right corner of the alphanumeric keyboard sends the code
08x to the computer.  (This is the same code that is sent when you hold
down the "Control" or CTRL key and simultaneously type the "H" key.)
These users expect that typing the Backspace key will cause the cursor
to move one position to the left and erase the character that formerly
resided in that position.  Sometimes this works, and everybody smiles.

If it does not, keystrokes of the Backspace key may echo on the screen
as a caret-H, looking like this:

    % more /etc/motd^H^H^H^H

This shows that the shell (in this case, the C shell) is not
interpreting the 08x code as the Unix "erase" function.  Usually this
means that Unix is expecting the Backspace key to emit the ASCII code
07Fx, as the ASCII standard says it should.  When the Unix shell sees
the 08x code, the shell thinks that Control-H is an intended part of 
the command line.

The opposite problem, when the Backspace key emits the 07Fx DEL code and
the shell expects 08x/Control-H for the Erase function, looks like this:

    % more /etc/motd^?^?^?^?

You can solve the problem in more than one way.  Somehow or other, though,
you have to get the keyboard and the running programs (which includes the
shell) to agree.  There are lots of ways to configure different keyboards.
Another way is to use a different shell: tcsh can understand either 08x
(Control-H) or 07fx (DEL) as the Erase key.

Or you can change the behavior with "stty":

    % stty erase  ^H
                  \
                   \__  at this point you type Control-V and then 
                        type the Backspace key (which emits Control-H);
                        then type the Return/Enter key. 


    % stty erase  ^?
                  \
                   \__  at this point you type Control-V and then 
                        type the Backspace key (which emits DEL);
                        then type the Return/Enter key. 

However, other programs may not go along with the "stty" setting.
Your mileage may vary.  For other discussion, see below.

 ........................................................................

If you want to know exactly what ASCII codes the computer is seeing when
you type a given key, try using the "od" (octal dump) utility, available
in most variants of Unix.

In recent releases of Solaris, this utility lives at
/usr/bin/od  and  /usr/xpg4/bin/od

Here follows an example, in I invoked the "od" command with two
arguments that tell it to use hexadecimal radix and notice "usual"
codes. With "od" running in Solaris, I typed the PF1 key on a DEC
VT220's LK201 keyboard and then hit the Return/Enter key, then
Control-D (to signal "end of input").

  % od -x -c

    ^[OP
    0000000    1b4f    500a
             033   O   P  \n
    0000004

  %

thus showing that the PF1 key emits this three-octet sequence:  Escape O P

In Red Hat Linux 2.2, this utility lives at  /usr/bin/od
and its output looks slightly different:

    $ /usr/bin/od -c -x
    ^[OP
    0000000 033   O   P  \n
            4f1b 0a50
    0000004
    $

stty controls your terminal settings.  UNIX terminal line protocol

map the delete key to a delete next char in your favorite editor.

In vi,  place the following in your .exrc file (replace <DEL> with

Well, you're awake, and there's points for that.  And you did say
"I don't think".  But that suggests you didn't try it.  I just did,
changing the 7th colon separated field of the ttymodes value from
7f (delete) to 08 (backspace) and rebooting.  Telnetted in when it
came back up, and the backspace that used to do ^H at the login
prompt now worked fine.  (Solaris 8, hacked to boot on an old Voyager,
but the hack has _nothing_ to do with options.conf)

So the points come off again for your speculation not having been
correct. :-)

Speculation pointed out as such may indeed identify potential problems.
But if it only takes a moment, actually trying it works much better.
(I _think_ I may have noted the effect of changes to options.conf on
pts devices sometime in the past, but I didn't specifically remember
that when I first posted on this, so I can't say whether or not I
was consciously speaking from experience then.  I mention that in the
spirit of "full disclosure" given that I'm being a bit critical here,
although I was (six sigma and and counting :-) correct.)

 Solaris X86 also provided the "pcmapkeys" utility (in SUNWcsu) to
 change the keyboard behavior of the raw console.

 [ Update: as of Solaris 8 X86, Sun changed the default key mappings
   on the PC-type keyboard to more closely resemble those of a SPARC
   machine's keyboard.  The pcmapkeys(1M) utility was removed.

   Other changes in Solaris 8 X86: the "console" screen was made to have
   black characters on a white backbround; the kadb kernel debugger may
   be entered by F1-A, analogous to L1-A on a SPARC. The un-documented,
   un-supported virtual terminal feature was made un-available.  Also
   the terminal type for the X86 console is no longer "AT386"; it is
   "sun-color". (SPARC consoles are "sun".)]

 ..............................................................................

To use an Intel-processor Sun LX50 server with a serial console, use
the "linux-serial" LILO option.

You do still work on the console?

On the Solaris machine extract termcap information for the requested terminal
type (sun-color):

        infocmp -C sun-color

Paste this information into /usr/share/misc/termcap of your FreeBSD
machine and rerun

        cap_mkdb /usr/share/misc/termcap

Now FreeBSD should recognise your sun-color terminal type.


FreeBSD's cons* terminal types should be compatible with AT386. So if you
log into a Sun box and the terminal type is set to cons25, just reset it
to AT386.

Or extract the definitions for cons25w and cons25 from FreeBSD's termcap into
a separate file on your Solaris machine. Then run

        captoinfo termcap-extracted > terminfo-cons25
        tic terminfo-cons25

This should add definitions for cons25 into Solaris' terminfo database.

If you have no keyboard connected the LX50 uses the serial ports
by default.  Even the BIOS works over the serial line.

Yes you can send a break signal - how you send it depends on what
software you are using to connect to the serial console.  If it is
tip the ~# if telnet ^] send brk.

Solaris x86 needs the eeprom settings changed thus:
        eeprom input-device=ttyb
        eeprom output-device=ttyb

Yes that is *ttyb* not ttya as it would be on a SPARC.  This is
because the serial ports on the LX50 are COM2 in MS-DOS terms.

The Solaris x86 equivalent of L1-A is Ctrl-Alt-D, but it works
only when the system was booted under kadb.

Before you unplug the keyboard:

    kbd -a disable

After you plug it back in:

    kbd -a enable

However, there may be a better way.  Why do you want to unplug
and re-plug a keyboard on a running machine?  Aren't there
enough Sun keyboards to go around?

If it's an unattended server, why don't you run it "headless"
(without screen or keyboard) all the time?

Thanks to all who responded.  I haven't worked much with Suns in over
twelve years, and am just now getting back into it.

We ended up uncommenting the "KEYBOARD_ABORT=disable" line in
/etc/default/kbd, and that did the trick.

Check the man page.  The "-a disable" option merely disables keyboard
break.  It doesn't disable typing on the keyboard.


% man kbd

     -a enable/disable/alternate state
           Enable,  disable,  or  alternate  the  keyboard  abort

           (typically Stop-A or L1-A on the keyboard and BREAK on
           the serial console device) suspends the operating sys-
           tem on most systems. The default keyboard behavior can
           be  changed  using this option. The -a option can only
           be used by a superuser.

I love the idea of the 'alternate' - it sets a sequence (by default,
three characters: carriage return, tilde and control-B (CR ~ CTRL-B))
that simulate the break action. The downside is that you should not run
PPP or similar binary protocols over the serial console port if this
option is enabled, as they might generate that sequence.

A "binary protocol" on the console port?  You're describing a DDT
[Don't Do That!] situation.

Besides the fact that the port is locked for the kernel's exclusive
access, the protocol would have intermittent kernel/syslog messages
inserted into its packets.

What nobody has mentioned is that, if this happens, you can type "go"
at the "ok" prompt and the system will resume operating.  It isn't
perfect, but it's better than rebooting.

I had this problem with CDE on hpux 10.20. Try xmodmap from command line:

trojan> xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x1b),  Shift_R (0x62)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x1d)
control     Control_L (0x1a),  Control_R (0x61)
mod1        Alt_L (0x22),  Alt_R (0x42)

If your mod1 line has a third entry, try this:

create file .xmodmaprc with the content
clear mod1
add mod1 = Alt_L
add mod1 = Alt_R

then run
xmodmap .xmodmaprc


Works for me.

If you boot a Sun Ultra 1 workstation with no Sun keyboard attached, it
will use /dev/term/a as its serial console.  If you are booting from the
Solaris 8 "1 of 2" installation CD-ROM, it will present the following

If you are trying to install Solaris on either a PC or SPARC--but using a
serial console instead of the graphics head--and then you get stuck at the 
point where the Install screen displays:

        - If your keyboard does not have function keys, or they do not
          respond, press ESC; the legend at the bottom of the screen
          will change to show the ESC keys to use for navigation.

        F2_Continue  F5_Exit  F6_Help

...and typing the keys labeled "F2" or "PF2" does not seem to work, then try
pressing the "Escape" key and then the "2" key to generate the F2_Continue
effect.

On the boot diskette for Solaris 8 x86, you can change to file

a:\solaris\bootenv.rc

to reflect that you would like to use the serial port on the
PC you are installing.

Change the lines:

setprop output-device screen
setprop input-device keyboard

to be

setprop output-device ttya
setprop input-device ttya

If the PC you are installing on has a supported serial port, the
DCA will use the serial port for configuration and and boot the
Solaris kernel from specified source.

My $0.25,

Andreas

Telnetting to a SPARC and sending the 'telnet break' signal, will do
absolutely *nothing* useful.

The CONSOLE has to get it.

When you are telnetted in, you are not connected to console.

The exception is when you are telnetted into a CISCO (or some other)
terminal concentrator, and are then connected via serial line from
the Cisco to the Sun's serial console port. At which point, the cisco
will convert the Telnet BREAK to a serial-line Break.

Subject: Hmm... pulling serial sends break key?

I have 4 headless Sun Blade 2000s, which I'm accessing thru a 9-to-25 pin
serial cable from my laptop, using tip.  I knew that rebooting my laptop
will send a BREAK sequence and taking the SunBlade down to the "ok" PROM
prompt.  I never knew that disconnecting the serial cable (from the
SunBlade) will also take it down to the "ok" prompt. Is this behavior new?

I used to yank serial cables from headless U5, U10, U60 all the time w/o
any problem. What causes it? The mysterious thing is, there are 4 boxes
here, and one is immune to this disease. As far as I can tell they are
built identically, except for  this eeprom setting:

#power-cycles=15

This is different for all 4 boxes?  What is this?  Is this even relevant?

It's caused by sending the system a 'break.'  Normally, an idle serial
line is in MARK state (negative voltage).  If it goes to SPACE
(positive) for a period of time longer than a legal character width,
then it's considered a "break."

Anything that causes a flap on the wires can cause this, including
power cycling the other device, changing bit rates, and yanking the
cable.

It's a long-standing issue on Solaris systems.  You can use the 'kbd'
utility to change the serial port to use the alternate break sequence
instead:

     A BREAK condition that originates from an erroneous electri-
     cal   signal  cannot  be distinguished from one deliberately
     sent by remote DCE. As a remedy,  use  the  -a  option  with
     Alternate  Break  to switch break interpretation. Due to the
     risk of incorrect sequence interpretation, binary  protocols
     such  as  PPP,  SLIP,  and others should not be run over the
     serial console port when  Alternate  Break  sequence  is  in
     effect.  The   Alternate Break sequence has no effect on the
     keyboard abort. For more information on the Alternate  Break
     sequence, see [man pages] zs(7D), se(7D), and asy(7D).

Ah, that's better.  :)  My reading of your original reply gave me the
impression you were suggesting Break was sufficient, leading me to wonder
if you might be answering the more frequently asked question of how to do
L1-A.  Also, I didn't actually know if there *was* a keyboard substitute
for L1-N, so my reply was partly asking how using Break helped (answer:
apparently there is indeed a "new command mode" equivalent for L1-N (see
below)).

Another poster followed up and said more about what to do after Break:

From: gerg@panix.com (Greg Andrews)
:
: No.  The most you can do from an RS232-connected terminal is send
: an RS232 Break signal to halt the machine to the boot prom's "ok"
: 
: However, at that point (the "ok" prompt), you can type the "set-defaults"
: command, which the boot prom manual says is the equivalent of Stop-N.

I managed to totally screw up the USB keyboard the other day on my Blade

That was never successful, so has some keys missing, like the pipe! I 
can just about use it though.

I have a type 7 on order. Is it possible to remove the old keyboard and 
fit the new one without risk of shutting the system down? I believe the 
escape sequence can be changed. Will that allow me to prevent it 
crashing while I replace the keyboard? I've got something running which 
will take two weeks to finish, but I don't want to wait 2 weeks before i 
change the keyboard.

The keyboard interface is USB, so you can unplug and re-plug the
keyboard without causing the machine to halt.

Unfortunately, unless something has changed since I last looked at
this, the only way to change that is to specify an option to the 
X server when it's started up.  If you're using the CDE login manager,
the X server is already started before you login, so you can't do that
easily.  (You'd have to do a "command line login" and then use "xinit"
to start the X server and pass the command line arguments to it.)

Anyway, the relevant section from "man Xsun" is this:

     -ar1 milliseconds
             Specify amount of  time  in  milliseconds  before  a
             pressed key begins to autorepeating.  The default is
             500 milliseconds.  This option is not  available  on
             Solaris x86 or PowerPC.

     -ar2 milliseconds
             specify  the  interval   in   milliseconds   between
             autorepeats of pressed keys.  The default is 50 mil-
             liseconds.  This option is not available on  Solaris
             x86 or PowerPC.

Hope that helps.

and blockmode spring to mind.

Oops, that was written before the morning's coffee has soaked in.
Peter's point is (obviously) that he is using termcap info for the
local terminal (whatever it is) to translate between it and a remote
VT100.  The VT100 knowledge is hardcoded, but knowledge about the
local terminal is table driven.

Depending on the capabilities of the local terminal (e.g. scrolling
regions, 80/132-column switching, etc), a serviceable termlib-based
VT100 emulator might be possible, to the extent it is useable by EMACS
or vi, but not necessarily by more demanding applications, such as
those found on VMS.

It's easy if you understand cryptic messages about shared libraries,
and are familiar with the politics regarding curses vs ncurses, libc
vs glibc, competing numbering schemes, etc, and what to do about them.

If xmodmap recognizes your keyboard and can see Shift-Alt-F7 as distinct from
other key combinations, then yes, but only for xterm.  A separate solution is
required for the console.  Remote (non-X) sessions haven't a prayer.


You win some and lose some.  UNIX is a general-purpose multiuser
operating system designed originally to be accessed from a terminal,
and in fact a variety of terminals.  The idea of a UNIX workstation
with its own keyboard and screen was grafted on later and is still not
a good fit.

DOS and Windows, on the other hand, are single-user operating systems
designed to be used *only* from the built-in keyboard, mouse, and
screen, and therefore include APIs (or direct hardware access) that
make terminal emulation possible in the sense that most people expect.
But this is at the expense of generalized accessibility.

It is hard to explain this to people who expect UNIX to be like Windows.

While it might be possible to write a true terminal emulator for a
specific UNIX variety on specific hardware that runs only in an 
X window (and in fact there are numerous examples -- xterm, Xfree86
xterm, the xterm versions from HP, IBM, and other companies that
emulate their own proprietary terminal types), it is not possible
in the general case, due to differences in hardware (e.g. different
keyboards), windowing systems (in the X environment), screen drivers
(in the console environment), APIs, and access methods.

Or just look at /usr/openwin/include/X11/Suncompose.h (maybe halfway down
in the file; search for "non-breaking").  Also perhaps look at
/usr/openwin/lib/locale/$LANG/Compose, for some $LANG other than C.

For those toolkits that know what to do with it at least (and at least
the handling of the light, and probably the state too, seems to be
toolkit dependent), the normal use is Compose <key1> <key2>, where
the sequences (for iso8859-1) are defined on

http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/806-4743/6jdq6q25k?q=compose+sequences&a=view

If I press <compose><s> in one Motif window,and move the focus to another,
and press <s> again, I just get an <s>.  But if I move back and press the
other <s>, _then_ I get an ß.  But the light gets confused, and turns off
when I press the <s> in the 2nd window.  At least, that's with xkb enabled;
there are some differences, i.e. without xkb enabled, I think the light
stays on throughout <compose><a><shift-">, but with xkb enabled, the light
always turns off on the 2nd keystroke after <compose>.

Anyway, if you pressed <compose> by accident, just press it again in the
same window to turn it off.  And remember that the light can be confused
rather easily.  Also, xset led 2 will turn it on (although subsequent
keystrokes may turn it off automatically), and xset -led 2 will turn it
off.  (the LED number may be different on x86, I'm not sure)

It seems to me there needs to be some work done on making the compose
handling more consistent between toolkits and between xkb/non-xkb mode.
It's a shame the compose state isn't global like the shift lock state,
but I'm not sure that's even possible while providing otherwise
correct and expected behavior.

Unless you've started the server with +kb, the XKB files aren't used on
Solaris.  Instead the keymaps in /usr/openwin/etc/keytables are used.
You could build a keymap based on one of those, and then modify 
the keytable.map in that directory to load it for whatever layout your
jumpers are set to.  (Be careful though, since patches/upgrades could
modify keytable.map.)

If you're happy running the keyboard with a special driver (XInput or
XTest extension routine or similar) off the serial port, all you need
is a voltage converter (e.g. MAX232) to bring the Sun keyboard's and
mouse's 5V voltage levels to RS232 standards. The keyboard runs at 1200
baud 8N1 IIRC - the specs are available from

    http://www.sparc.org/

The mouse should use s.th. similar to the Mouse Systems protocol - take a
look at the Linux kernel sources for more information.

Running the keyboard as a real system keyboard is a lot more difficult
as this requires converting the keycodes as well as converting the
data format from asynchronous to synchronous serial format. I posted
some links on ready-to-build interfaces using microcontrollers in
c.s.s.h about two weeks ago.

You can buy the specs for Sun type 5 keyboards under "SPARCshop" at:

If you want to experiment, please note that Sun keyboards use 5V signal

more information on the keycodes from Linux and Net/OpenBSD source code.
The pinout of the mini DIN keyboard plug should be in the Sun Hardware FAQ
(find it on www.sunhelp.com or sun3arc.krupp.org - the new home of doener, 
Heiko Krupp's great Sun3 web site).

   [2005: the Sun3Arc site is no longer online, but part of it was preserved:

    See also http://www.sunshack.org/]

For Linux, I recommend linux/drivers/sbus/char/sunkbd.c and sunkeymap.c

Btw., I'm trying to build the opposite - a microcontroller device that
permits the use of PS/2 keyboards and mice on Sparcs and Sun 3 systems 
(if you like older Suns like me you probably have lots of machines and not
enough keyboards ...).

This will probably be based on an Atmel AT90S2313 microcontroller - these
are small, available at relatively low prices, in-system flash programmable
and RISC CPU's :-). If I get it running, I plan to release the controller 
source code under GPL.

I know that I can buy an adapter from SunExpress that does exactly the same
but this isn't fun ;-) (and it's expensive - but the Atmel controllers cost
$6 in single-piece quantities and need only minimal external circuitry).

The latest version of xkeycaps[1] doesn't support Type6.

Find the keycodes with xev(1), get the KeySyms from your old Type5-xmodmap,
build a new map with xmodmap(1) and modify it. [2] might be of help.

I purchased one of these recently to attach a PS/2 keyboard and mouse to my
Sun Ultra 5, however, I've been dissatisfied with the mouse's performance.
There appears to be a slight delay between my moving the mouse and the
screen cursor.  Solaris' mouse controls for acceleration and threshold can
not solve the problem since it deals with hesitation and not resolution.  
At first, Belkin's customer support claimed the problem was the Microsoft
Intellimouse I was using, even though none of their documentation makes this
claim.  After getting the same results with a standard 2 button PS/2 mouse,
they now claim the box may be defective.

Is anyone else using this product?  How does it work for you?  Maybe my box
is defective!

vt320's don't send anything for F1-F5 (PF1-PF4 are on the numeric keypad).
It sounds as if someone's using an xterm keyboard.

Uh, key layout has nothing to do with whether it's Type6 or Type5c.
I have a US UNIX Type6 USB keyboard, with the keys in just the right
places.

Sure, as far as I recall Sun altered some keytables in a recent
Xsun patch or so, since then the tilde is gone (at least with
a German keyboard).

At least in a terminal window you can press tilde, then space,
to let the tilde show up.

The main differences is that on the PC layout, the Caps Lock key is to
the left of the A, and the Escape key is up with the Help key and the
function keys. 

The Unix layout has the Control key to the left of the A, and the
Escape key is next to the 1. 

There are a few other keys that move around, like ~ IIRC, but most
people are only affectionate about those two keys' placement.

Some will work, some will not.  We've used an older Cherry
USB-keyboard with SunRays, and I think I tried a keyboard from a
Compaq iPaq, but I'm not sure.  I was under the impression most USB
keyboards would "just work".

Anyway, I'd miss the hell out of the left function keys, if using a PC
keyboard.  This is why Solaris x86 has always felt wrong for me as a
desktop computer.


(We use Suns on the desktop, and Solaris x86 on the server end.  Dare
to be different :) )

We also have two brand-new SunBlade 1000's here which were ordered
without keyboards and mice ("oh well, we've got lots of type 5
keyboards around" ... and found only a USB connector on the machine).

No problem, I thought--just get a USB keyboard from the Mac next
door and boot the machine up. It seems that the Blade 1000 is 
explicitly checking for the USB vendor or device ID of the keyboard
as it complained about not being able to find a keyboard :-/.
This doesn't really make sense IMO.

Does anyone know if there is a way to get third-party USB keyboards

For those who care...

I finally got a PS2-with-USB-adapter PC keyboard (MS Natural Keyboard
to be exact) to work with the SunBlade 100. The trick is to boot with
the Sun USB keyboard, and then at the login screen, switch the Sun with
the PC, using the same USB slot.

xkeycaps also helps with restoring sane key mappings...

Look at the /usr/dt/config/Xservers file.  At the bottom of the file is a
line to start the X server.  At the end of that line, add something like
"-ar1 300 -ar2 30".  -ar1 specifies the delay time, and -ar2 specifies
the interval.  See the Xsun man page.

Copy the file to /etc/dt/config and edit it there if you want it to
survive a Solaris upgrade:

    # mkdir -m 755 -p /etc/dt/config
    # cd              /etc/dt/config
    # cp              /usr/dt/config/Xservers .

There is when you're using bash or tcsh.

To map F6 to "ps -ef" in tcsh, use the bindkey built-in:

  $ bindkey -c ^[[17~ "ps -ef"

To type the F6 key sequence to the shell, press "control-v F6". 
Obviously, this can be placed in your start-up file (.cshrc).

In bash, the same is achieved through the "bind" built-in. Use "read"
to find the key sequence emitted by F6

  $ read
  ^[[17~

The ^[ is the ESC character, which in bash is represented by
\e (backslash e), so to map F6 onto "ps -ef" you'd type:

$ bind '"\e[17~":  "ps -ef^M"'

(Press "control-v control-m" to enter the Return.)

On start-up, bash reads the ~/.inputrc file to map keys or character
sequences to shell commands.

Take care,

Subject: Re: Avant keyboard

: The L-shaped enter key really is truly useless, I wonder why
: it's so popular...
: 

Political correctness.  This all started, I think, with some massive
"human factors" study commissioned by DEC in Europe, which ultimately
resulted in some DIN standards and the LK (canoe paddle) keyboard.  I'm
pretty sure this was at least a year or two before the IBM 101 keyboard.
(I remember first seeing the keyboards at a nondisclosure presentation
of... I think it was the Pro 350?... and being utterly appalled.  Of
course the Pro 350 offered a wide choice of appalling features.  Didn't
DEC finally empty its warehouses of them by making them into consoles
for the VAX 8700?)

Before that was a long period of "let the 100 flowers bloom", and some
very nice keyboards appeared, such as on the Concept-100.  Back in those
days, people touch typed, and there was value in having all the keys in
striking distance of the home keys.

The DEC study was basically geared towards making computers (and
therefore keyboards) more friendly to the general non-computer-using
public, thereby increasing the market for computers and terminals.  So
as a result we had to have all these ergonomically huge Return/Enter
and Shift keys, and whatnot (though, ironically, they never thought of
a HELP key).  Implicit in the process was the recognition that (a) the
terminal-host model was dead (so we don't need Ctrl or Esc keys any
more), and (b) touch-typing was a discredited legacy concept (because
it is not a mass-market phenomenon).

The ultimate insult to the Old Guard was putting Caps Lock where Ctrl
was.  What could be more useless?  This seemed to send us directly
back to the ASR 33 Teletype days when computers spoke only upper case.
(Those of us who remember the VT50 and earlier still recall the
liberating sensation of entering and viewing lowercase on the VT52 and
early DECwriters.)

To add fuel to the fire, various European government procurement
bodies began to *require* the new layout, so by 1983 or so, the only
keyboards available were essentially today's DEC and IBM layouts.  At
least DEC waffled by leaving Ctrl in the same row, rather than moving
it way down to tendon-twisting territory.  But anyway, what it all
adds up to is: you're supposed to be using a mouse, not a keyboard.

And that's why the market for good keyboards is a vanishingly small one.

320-1270 | 320-1271   | "US" or PC-style
320-1272 | 320-1273   | "US/UNIX"

If you prefer the 320-1270 (DIN) then you should be using 320-1271 for
your USB connected keyboard. They have the same layout and as far as I
can say the only difference between them is color and marking on the
power key.

Apparently you have the wrong keyboard for your preferences so you
should really clear this out with your sales rep.

I used to buy Sun equipment before joining Sun and the only time I got
the wrong keyboard (I like the unix style) was when I forgot to
specify the keyboard. If you don't specify a keyboard with you order
you will get a PC style national keyboard, which in my case would be a
Swedish keyboard. I won't speculate why you got the wrong keyboard.

I rest my case.

The other poster gave you the link to the pinouts.

What he didn't tell you, and what I don't think you're aware of, is
that the signals from the Sun keyboard and the PS/2 keyboard are
not compatible. It's going to take more than just a simple cable
adapter to make a standard PC keyboard work on a Sun.

Sun used to (might still) sell a PS/2 converter for about $75, so
you can use a PS/2 keyboard and mouse together on a Sun. The FAQ
section you were referenced to also mentions another keyboard 
converter that is certainly NOT inexpensive...

These seem to work best with Logitech 3-button mice.

Several special keys from the Sun keyboards are emulated by pressing
the following keys on a PC-type keyboard:

   Mapping: Right-Control --> Meta (the diamond-Sun-logo key)
            Right-Alt     --> AltGraph
            Pause/Break   --> Stop

(These are the Control and Alt keys on the Right side of the PC keyboard;
the similar keys on the Left side work in the normal way.  The Sun console
Stop-A function, if enabled, is produced by the combination Pause/Break-A.)

Unfortunately, all I can tell you is that it depends on the converter
box. On mine (a Belkin model), it is Ctrl-F1+A.  And by the way, this is
"old" Sun to PS2 (connecting something like the Ultra 5/10).

I also have a Blade100 (USB-to-PS2), and use a Belkin model to connect
it.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no Stop-A sequence for this
converter, so I have to play with the power button on start up to get it
to break (pressing the power button, waiting 3-5 seconds or so, then
pressing it again--for me, it is still hit-or-miss).  This may hold true
for other USB boxen (etc SB2000), but I have never tested this with them.

You can reprogram the Stop-A sequence to be different so you can
use any keyboard (well, that is as soon as the OS is up and running)

E.g., by deriving something more generic from:

Should be possible.

Change the switches to match the current layout.

The Type 5c keyboards have jumpers for "US", "US/Unix" and "Japanese"
layouts and switches for the other layouts.


The UK layout should hav be: off on on on off (hex code 2e)
The US layout should be: out out out out in (hex code 21)

Good luck.

If it gives you the "ok" prompt, you should be ok.  If it gives the ">"
prompt, type n, and if it prompts for a password it's protected; if it
just gives you "ok ", it's not.

Of course, that assumes you've got a working console connection. :-/

Sun keyboard cables: old keyboards use a DB-15 connector; new keyboards
use a miniDIN-8.  Through at least the type-5, they are all
electrically compatible, and in my experience you can use type-3,
type-4, and type-5 indiscriminately, with only passive adapters needed.

Sun sells an adapter cable for using new keyboards on old machines.
But it's expen$ive, it's unnecessary, and they don't sell one for using
old keyboards on new machines.

It's easy to wire one up.  Here's what you need to know.

Connector pinouts
(male connectors viewed end-on, i.e., pins pointing towards you):

  miniDIN-8                                DB-15

1 Gnd   5 KTx                  1 KRx   5 MRx   9 Gnd  13 (not connected)
2 Gnd   6 KRx                  2 Gnd   6 Gnd  10 Vcc  14 Vcc
3 Vcc   7 MTx                  3 KTx   7 MTx  11 Vcc  15 Vcc
4 MRx   8 Vcc                  4 Gnd   8 Gnd  12 Vcc

You thus need at least six conductors in the cable, four signal and two
power.  (Actually, you need only three signal lines, because the line
from the CPU to the mouse is not needed.  But I can never remember
whether that's MRx or MTx; I wire it up anyway.)

The cable for using a modern keyboard on an old machine thus looks like
this.  This cable plugs into the keyboard at the miniDIN-8 end and the
machine at the DB-15 end.

The cable needed to use an old keyboard on a modern machine is the
same, except that the DB-15 is female instead and the diagram hence
shows it from the back instead of the front; this version of the cable
plugs into the machine at the miniDIN-8 end and into the keyboard cable
(which is permanently attached to the keyboard) at the DB-15 end.

No.  The most you can do from an RS232-connected terminal is send
an RS232 "BREAK" signal to halt the machine to the boot prom's "ok"
prompt.  (the equivalent of Stop-A rather than Stop-N)

However, at that point (the "ok" prompt), you can type the "set-defaults"
command, which the boot prom manual says is the equivalent of Stop-N.

That's fine, too.  Plug in the keyboard, hold down Stop-N, and power
the IPX up.  Keep holding the Stop-N for at least 30 seconds, then
let go and power the IPX off again.  That will have reset the NVRAM
to defaults.

Then unplug the Sun keyboard and power the IPX back up.  It will
come up with NVRAM defaults and using the serial port as the console.

Even under CDE and Gnome 2.0, the Volume keys call a program within
Solaris to actually enact volume up/down and mute. As a result,
CSW Gnome 2.6 (which I use, occasionally) has this problem.

To fix it--you will need to find some mechanism within KDE to exec
a program on certain keypresses ('SunAudioMute' 'SunAudioLowerVolume'
and 'SunAudio RaiseVolume')

On Solaris 9, the programs you need to execute are as follows, you can
test this from a command line if necessary:

    /usr/dt/appconfig/sdtvolctl/muteVolume
    /usr/dt/appconfig/sdtvolctl/volumeDown
    /usr/dt/appconfig/sdtvolctl/volumeUp

Additionally, instead of kmix (which may or not work) you may wish to
use the default solaris mixer:

    /usr/dt/bin/sdtaudiocontrol

I hope this is of some use.

This meme keeps getting spread, but it completely incorrect.
You do not need to remove a graphics card to do serial console.

You remove the _keyboard_ and _just_ the keyboard, then it will find no
keyboard and do serial console. You can also remove the graphics card
if you want to, but there is _no_ requirement to.

You can do that if you want to retain keyboard/monitor (for
xdm/CDE/whatever) and still have a serial console.

On a Sun5c keyboard (without any strange xmodmap trickery) the following
are the keysyms on the keypad:

              / => F25   * => F26     - => F24
  7 => F27    8 => Up    9 => F29
  4 => Left   5 => F31   6 => Right   + => KP_Add
  1 => F33    2 => Down  3 => F35
  0 => KP_Insert         . => Delete  Enter => KP_Enter

NumLock is Num_Lock, but as it is a locking modifier you should not
normally bind to it but instead use [expr {%s & 32}] to determine what
mode the keyboard is in.

I think I had a similar issue on a P2B board, when I had power
management enabled in the BIOS ("enable suspend mode after one hour of
inactivity").

Here's an old usenet article I wrote a year ago (includes a hint how to
reset the kernel's timer code after a wakeup from suspend mode):

Oh, and a follow up... I just received my adapter from Sun Xpress...
And you do not need the Sun keyboard in order to do an L1-A.

They map the PAUSE key on the PS/2 keyboard to be STOP, so you can use
PAUSE-A and get the same results..

Just thought you'd like to know.  The converter is really nice, and is
going to make my job that much easier since I won't be stuck on these
Sun type 4/5 keyboards any longer...  Bleh, as if Sun knew what
ergonomic meant!

Now I just gotta figure out how to make Solaris 2.5 switch the Control
and CapsLock keys.  I tried doing it while using the type 5 keyboard
plugged into the adapter but it didn't work...  I'll have to see what
the PS/2 keyboard does, and I believe there was something about
switching the Control/CapsLock somewhere in the Solaris 2.x FAQ... I
*like* my Control key next to the A... :)

Nope.  The Type 5[c] keyboard is the one most often associated with
Suns, but it only comes with the Sun keyboard interface.  The Type 6
keyboard which replaces is available with the Sun interface, as well
as USB.  The trouble is, compared to Type 5s, they feel like cheap crap!

With pre-Sun Blade machines, you have a choice: use a crappy Type 6,
or use a (probably non-new) Type 5.  Unfortunately, SB 100[0] only
have a USB interface, so you have to use a Type 6 keyboard.  Even
worse, the Type 6 doesn't even have a USB hub built in, to facilitate
plugging the mouse into the keyboard, like Andy* intended; you have
to run a separate wire to the case, like peecees, which I think is
a huge step backwards.

Both the Type 5 and Type 6 keyboards a variety of layouts, including
a "UNIX" one, with Control, Esc, and other keys in the right place,
and a peecee layout, which has the keys in the wrong place.  (Control
immediately to the left of A is the right place!)

Type 5 keyboards are beige, have the "lock" leds in the keys, and have a
straight line top - Type 6 can be grey/purple and have an arc-shaped
top, with the "lock" leds in a row on top.  Both types come in either
"PC style" or "Unix style" layouts in a variety of languages.  Type 6
come with either old-fashioned Sun connector or a USB connection, while
Type 5 only have the Sun connector (Type 5 have a seperate cable, Type
5c have the cable permanently attached).

You can see Type 6 in these SunRay pictures:
        http://www.sun.com/sunray/product/

Part of a Type 5 is visible in the "Input Devices" picture here:

If you can't find a BREAK key, you can turn the bitrate way down to
50 baud and press space a few times.  (this is the method we used with
the awful glass ttys we had 10 years ago.)

Subject: 8.2)    How do I swap the CAPS LOCK and CONTROL keys on a
                 type 5 keyboard under Openwindows 3.x?

  There are two ways to do it, one with xmodmap (for X11 only), and the
  other using keytables.

  Margarita Suarez <marg@manila.cc.columbia.edu> suggests editing
  $OPENWINHOME/etc/keytables/US5.kt. There are two places where keys 119
  (CapsLock) and 76 (Control) should be swapped: the MODMAP section and the
  KEYSYMMAP section. The latter is most important, because that's where the
  "Pseudo-Lock" function (which controls the locking behaviour of the key) is
  defined.

  Doug Hughes <Doug.Hughes@Eng.Auburn.EDU> suggests using xmodmap with
  the following:

        remove Lock = Caps_Lock
        remove Control = Control_L
        keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
        keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
        add Lock = Caps_Lock
        add Control = Control_L

  In X11, you can change your keyboard layout as you please using the
  xkeycaps application, which allows you to edit and remap your keyboard
  on the fly, as well as save configurations to be sourced by xmodmap.

  xkeycaps is available from http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/
  and in the contrib section of your friendly X11 source archive.

  Thanks to Dan Pritts <danno@ans.net> for the info on xkeycaps.


 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 [Archiver's Note:]

Suppose on a Solaris system, either SPARC or Intel CPU, you may have a
PC-101-layout keyboard, which has the Caps Lock key at the left of the
letter A, and has the Control (Ctrl) key down in pinkie-cramp territory.

Now further suppose that you want to swap the functions of these two
keys for *all* users who login to this system.  (You are using CDE, so
the OpenWindows technique does not apply.) Under CDE, here's what to do.

    Become the root user.

    Create (or verify the existence of) the directory /etc/dt/config

    If you created the directory, copy the default Xsetup file there:

        # cp  /usr/dt/config/Xsetup  /etc/dt/config

    (If an Xsetup file is already there, you'll need to edit it.)
    Give this file 755 permissions "-rwxr-xr-x".

    Create a file in this directory with the name

        /etc/dt/config/capslock_control_swap.map

    containing the following lines (as shown in "man xmodmap"):
    
        !
        !  Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
        !
        remove      Lock =             Caps_Lock
        remove   Control = Control_L
        keysym             Control_L = Caps_Lock
        keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
        add         Lock =             Caps_Lock
        add      Control = Control_L


    In the file /etc/dt/config/Xsetup, append a line saying

        /usr/openwin/bin/xmodmap  /etc/dt/config/capslock_control_swap.map

Then, when the X server is restarted, the key functions will be swapped.


 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Q: How to find out key codes under X for different keys?

A: 

1. Bring up OpenWindows.

                     2. From a shelltool or cmdtool invoke:
                        "$OPENWINHOME/demo/xev"

                     3. "xev" will put up a Window labeled "Event Tester",
                        move the mouse/pointer into this window.

                        Reference --> "man xev"

                     4. Now hit the key you're trying to map through loadkeys.
                        Example: pressing the "Del/." key on Numpad yields
                        "keycode 57".

                     5. Subtract 7 from the "xev" keycode to
                        derive the "loadkeys" keystation number:
                        57 - 7 = 50.

                     6. Now "loadkeys somefile" can be used to remap key50.
                        Example (make this key emanate "dog") -->
                        loadkeys somefile

                        where "somefile" has 1 line in it --> key 50 all "dog"

                     Reference "man loadkeys" "man 5 keytables".

                     Note: Caveat --> "loadkeys" has NO EFFECT on OpenWindows.
                           It only effects key mappings in Sunview or the
                           Single Console.



 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        In 1995,  Microsoft introduced a new ergonomic keyboard called the
        Microsoft Natural Keyboard.  This keyboard (among other things)
        has three extra keys.  Two of the new keys bear a "Windows" logo.
        The last key has a picture of a cursor over a menu.

        Members of the X consortium and other vendors discussed
        this and concluded that:

                the windows keys should generate XK_Meta
                the menu key should generate XK_Menu

        A new keyboard type/table was added to the Xsun server
        to implement the new keysyms for the new keys.

If it works, that would set the LED, which according to what you describe
would be enough to cause the X server to assume the corresponding shift
state at startup.

But (if only for completeness), it looks like there's no way (short of
digging in /dev/kmem in a most outrageous manner) to programmatically
manipulate the shift state while in plain old console mode.  It might
be nice if there were an additional kb(7m) ioctl to do that; I'd think
it would be easy enough to implement...

Good try but no cigar, Casper.

I entered this command interactively and via a profile without noticeable

Edit the keytable to suit; that requires you to find out what the returned
keycodes are.

(Probably requires you to write a program to fecth untranslated key
events)

If you've selected the appropriate locale, the characters are available
through either the compose feature (for example, _ is generated by
hitting ComposeSS, and d i or x by "composing" "a, 'e and /o). Other
symbols are generated with AltGraph: $ is AltGraphE, for instance.

Take care,

"C" is selected, the Compose key will not work as expected. This
documented somewhere in the CDE or release docs.

Workaround: set default locale to a ISO8859-1 locale in
/etc/dt/config/Xconfig as documented in dtlogin. This also causes
the ugly rectangle to disappear under each window.

BTW: the default locale of the system seems to be set in /etc/TIMEZONE
by setting something like this:

LC_COLLATE=de_DE.ISO8859-1
LC_CTYPE=de_DE.ISO8859-1
LC_MESSAGES=de.ISO8859-1
LC_MONETARY=de_DE.ISO8859-1
LC_NUMERIC=de_DE.ISO8859-1
LC_TIME=de_DE.ISO8859-1


Cheers,

Tom

The locale setting ("LC_CTYPE=en_GB export LC_CTYPE") tells
your applications that you want to use 8-bit characters like \243.
But it doesn't influence your keyboard layout.

Instead, use <compose><L><-> or add the KeySymName "sterling"
appropriately to your xmodmap.

The xmodmap program is what you want.  Find the keycode of the key you
want to map to Compose (a useful tool for this is /usr/openwin/demo/xev,
if you have it installed, run it and type keys into the window).  On my
keyboard, the right Control key is keycode 71.

Create a file called .Xmodmap in your home directory containing this line:

    keycode 71 = SunCompose

Now type at a shell prompt:

    % xmodmap .Xmodmap

The right control key is now Compose, and works just like a Sun.  If you
want to use the Right Alt key instead, substitute keycode 69 (to find
other keycodes, use /usr/openwin/demo/xev).  To make this permanent, put the
xmodmap command somewhere where it will be executed after OpenWindows starts
(depending on your configuration, this could be .xinitrc or
.openwin-init). Enjoy!

By the way, I had a very difficult time with this same problem in
FreeBSD (XFree86).  I could never get Netscape (an X11R5 binary) to
recognize the accented characters.  I guess that's one advantage of
Solaris...

The bug's been there for years on x86, at least back to Solaris 2.5.
It's not that the key is lost, but the dtterm seems to get into a
state where it thinks you are entering a compose sequence when you
return to use it.

If the two-key sequence is an invalid compose sequence (as most are),
the first key is ignored. If it is a valid compose key sequence, you
get the character the first two keypresses represent, e.g. '\337' if
you typed two 's's.

I never worked out what caused this seemingly random setting of the
compose state, but, as you say, it happens when you haven't used a
window for a while (and possibly if you've been using another window
in the mean time, although I'm not sure if that's a prerequisite).

That's backwards compatibility for you - the keys were not labeled with

(Or so I've been told by those who've been around much longer than I

as SunF36 and SunF37.

The "classic" operations are the default binding.  Any user of xterm

Any experience how well this things work? Can one use the copy, paste
etc. keys?

I have a solution which works fine with linux+xfree but it fails with
solaris+xsun. The kernel seems to recognize the keys, but I cant use
them in X.  Hmmm.

Subject: SUMMARY: getting vt100 keypad on sun4 keyboard in xterm

Heya,

	A couple of weeks ago I asked how one goes about getting the
	sun4 keypad to put out the escape sequences for the vt100 keys
	(like PF1 and its ilk)

	I got lots of responses, and thanks to everyone who made
	suggestions.

	There were several suggestions that indicated xmodmap.
	Unfortunately, I didn't want to remap the keyboard for all
	windows, only for a couple that were unfortunate enough to have
	to access a VAX.

	The solution I settled on uses the translation resource in
	xterm.  Here's what you do:

1) add the following lines to your .Xdefaults file (note that the first
   character of each of these `string' commands is an ESC (^[), so if it
   got nuked in transit, this won't work.  I'll put a uuencoded version of
   this at the bottom of this message just in case.):

----cut here----
XTerm*vt100.translations: 	#override \
   !Shift <Key>R1:		keymap(vt100)
XTerm*vt100Keymap.translations:	#override \
   <Key>R4:				string("OP")\n\
   <Key>R5:				string("OQ")\n\
   <Key>R6:				string("OR")\n\
   <Key>KP_Subtract:	string("OS")\n\
   Shift<Key>KP_2:		string("B")\n\
   Shift<Key>KP_4:		string("D")\n\
   Shift<Key>KP_6:		string("C")\n\
   Shift<Key>KP_8:		string("A")\n\
   <Key>KP_0:			string("Op")\n\
   <Key>KP_1:			string("Oq")\n\
   <Key>KP_2:			string("Or")\n\
   <Key>KP_3:			string("Os")\n\
   <Key>KP_4:			string("Ot")\n\
   <Key>KP_5:			string("Ou")\n\
   <Key>KP_6:			string("Ov")\n\
   <Key>KP_7:			string("Ow")\n\
   <Key>KP_8:			string("Ox")\n\
   <Key>KP_9:			string("Oy")\n\
   <Key>KP_Decimal:		string("On")\n\
   <Key>KP_Add:			string("Ol")\n\
   <Key>R2:				string("Om")\n\
   <Key>KP_Enter:		string("OM")\n\
   !Shift <Key>R1:		keymap(None)
----cut here----

2) use xrdb to get the window manager to notice that something was
   changed

xrdb ~/.Xdefaults

3) start up an xterm.

Once the xterm starts up, if you type Shift-R1, it turns on the vt100
keymap which remaps the type 4 keypad to look like this:

+---------------------------+
|      |      |Scroll| Num  |
|Pause |  ,   |Lock/ | Lock |
|      |      |Break |      |
|------+------+------+------|
|      |      |      |      |
| PF1  | PF2  | PF3  | PF4  |
|      |      |      |      |
|------+------+------+------|
|      |      |      |      |
|  7   |  8   |  9   |      |
|      |      |      |      |
|------+------+------+  -   |
|      |      |      |      |
|  4   |  5   |  6   |      |
|      |      |      |      |
|------+------+------+------|
|      |      |      |      |
|  1   |  2   |  3   |  E   |
|      |      |      |  n   |
|------+------+------+  t   |
|             |      |  e   |
|      0      |  .   |  r   |
|             |      |      |
+---------------------------+

When shifted, 8, 4, 6, and 2 return the usual cursor motion codes.

Note that only the current xterm is affected.  If you start up a new
one, it will come up with the original keys and you'll have to press
Shift-R1 to get it to use the vt100 bindings.

Pressing Shift-R1 again returns the normal keypad.

If anyone wants a copy of all the mail I got, send me email.

Thanks again to everyone who offered suggestions.

|

Software will not solve the problem of the key powering up the system.
Suggestions:

  1. Get rid of the cat.  (Had to say it since I have dogs).
  
  2. The keyboard power-up key runs directly to pin 7 of the
     keyboard connector:
     
               6    7    8
               
              5     4      3
               
                 2     1
                 
     The signal is active low and pulled up inside the workstation,
     so any method of preventing this signal from being pulled down
     will work (pop the key cover off and jam the switch, break the
     pin off at the connector, cut the trace inside the keyboard, ....
     there are many ways to skin a ......).

You shouldn't need to, unless your keyboard is completely different than
any of the existing standard keyboards already supported by Solaris
(USB, PS/2 & Sun/serial).  If you want to though, then you'll have to
learn about streams modules, and make a vuid module for it if you want
Xsun support.

This is discussed frequently in this newgroup.  Google for them.

Basicly, if you want to understand the UNIX environment more, read up on 
the shell.  You can have different ones.  Some shells support the use of 
the arrow keys while others don't.  You may have your account defined 
with one of the unsupported shells.  Contact your UNIX admin for more 
information.

I disassembled a *FILTHY* Type 4 once. The switches are really 
simple. Under each key is a pad with copper foil on it, to make the 
connections on the pcb. It's pretty easy to take apart and 
clean--worth a shot.

I do but they are rather dirty and untested.

thanks to all who offered their help!

cleaning did the trick.  in the kitchen sink with a little liquid

blow-dry with the air hose at my friend's engine shop and a thorough
airing-out, and they're all back...

Hi,

How can I make Linux (in a console mode)
use such keys like: ctrl+up or ctrl+down ?
I've heard that I should use terminfo files.

Short answer: Linux console doesn't implement this.

It's an option with XFree86 xterm, but would require more than
changing the terminfo file.

Make a new keymap:

#! /bin/loadkeys
keycode 103 = Up
control keycode 103 = F100
string F100 = "whee!"

Replace "whee!" with some suitable escape sequence.
Then change your programs to recognize that sequence.

My mileage varied with this keyboard from yours ...

I found it to be TOOOOO SMALLLLL to be useful.  They seem to *like* the 
idea of pressing the CONTROL key (or other modifier) to generate 
anything except for normal characters.  Me, I like the arrow keys, and 
PgUp/Down keys, and Home/End/Delete keys, and it was too jarring to have 
to press funky sequences just to get them.

My Happy Hacking keyboard was recently was donated to CRC
(http://www.crc.org/) along with the last of my WinTel/LinTel equipment
... I am now totally *switched* to Mac OS X (for  personal use; my work
computer is still a Win2k laptop, unfortunately).

You can plug a type 6 (USB) Sun keyboard into a PeeCee.  This works fine
as I am using one right now to type this email.  Don't know if you can
order one separately from a SunBlade*.

Answer: bug?? or MS anti-competition modification

After serveral emails w/Dr. Thomas.Blin
The only way to get the keyboard working, save the \| key:
power down, boot into prom, boot init s, init 2, then init 3
if the alpha is booted directly into CDE, or from the prom into CDE, the MS
keyboard will hang the console. There is no USB support. 

The \| key works until init 2 is reached, which is very odd, in the prom
and init s it puts out a |, in init 2 it puts out a ^@ and in init 3--nothing.

option: anectodal evidence of older MS natural keyboards working: did
MS change the keyboard at some point? the one I have is a new form-factor,
different than when they first came out. I have an older one that, if I
can find, I'll try. 

Compaq doesn't sell an ergonomic keyboard. 

solution: use my laptop (linux supports the usb version) as an Xterm when
my wrists start to hurt

Hi,

Sorry to report no success, we tried a new firmware 
but were unable to have the keyboard recognized.

Hi,

I do not know anything about Compaq PersonalWorkstation 500, but we had a
similar problem with our ES40 when delivered with a standard keyboard.  The
answer in our case was to change the country code at the SRM prompt.   (If
there is an SRM on the Compaq PersonalWorkstation 500 !).

I did this on a 735, guess it should be possible on a 715 also..  I've got

Keyboard/mouse port is HP-HIL only.
You can also use a serial terminal (or emulator)
on one of the serial ports, but you won't
have full graphical workstation in that case.
If all you need is a Unix server, serial
console might be acceptable.

> ...C1400A keyboard (with no cable).

You need one of the following product numbers:
  46020A  ITF layout
  46021A  ITF layout
  46021B  ITF layout
  46021C  ITF layout
  C1429A  PC-101 layout
Don't use:
  98203C  RMB layout
All discontinued, and there's some chance
HP itself can't even sell you one as a 
replacement part. 

Assuming you need the U.S.English layout, the web site

http://partsurfer.hp.com/

shows a part 46021-60401 $52.00 HP-UX keyboard assembly (Parchment white)  

> The cable that the guy is selling has got a HP-HIL

HIL is 4 wire plus shield.
AMP SMD connector. 
Connectors and tools aren't generally
available to fabricate your own cables.

Keyboards with 6-wire RJ12C connector
are usually either HP MITF-5 or MITF-12
keyboard port standard (used only by HP).
6-pin DIN or mini-DIN would be PC-AT or
PS/2 industry standard.

HIL-to-PS/2 adaptors used to be available,
but are off the market now. There's some
chance that if you order a replacement HIL
keyboard, you might get a PS/2 keyboard and
HIL adaptor.

You can't use it
(unless it includes the terminal :-)

You are aware, of course, that a $300 Wal-Mart
PC is faster than that 50MHz PA box.

Some little remark here :

the connector to connect the interface to the workstation differs whether
your workstation is a 715/33 or 715/80.

You can't connect the interface of 715/33, 715/50 to a 715/80, even though
the connector looks the same...

Likely, your old KVM didn't map ScrollLock to the Sun power button and
whatever it did map to that was more difficult to press accidentally.

Try editing /etc/default/sys-suspend and change the PERMS variable to be
PERMS=-

That disallows suspends by anyone except root.


Alternately, edit /usr/openwin/lib/speckeysd.map. Comment out the lines
that reference "SunPowerSwitch". Restart your X server, including dtlogin.

Alternately alternately, remove the power management packages altogether,
if you're not using them.  I forget the package names right now -- sorry.

You'll be able to use any PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard as well as any SVGA

The files in that directory show the USB keycode value--X adds an
offset to this to make room for the mouse buttons in the bottom of 
the keycode range returned.  If not using XKB, the offset is 
(8 - MINSCANCODE) as noted in the comments in the keytable.  (If using
XKB, the formula is the same, but instead of using MINSCANCODE from the
old keytable file, it uses 4 for USB and 0 for PC non-USB.)

I believe you can have a per-user "$HOME/.keytable" that is read when
you start X. This was the way I fixed the broken PC-style keyboard
layout I had on the SPARCbook I had many years ago.

A snippet from /usr/openwin/etc/keytables/US5.kt:

---
#
# You should probably start with a copy of an existing keytable and
# replace the existing scancodes with your new scancodes.  Then,
# incrementally modify entries as needed.  To test a new keytable,
# copy it to $HOME/.keytable and start Xsun.

Right.  I knew there was something I was forgetting.  It's still startup-
time only though (which means I don't think it will work with dtlogin,
but only with xinit/openwin).   Of course, my brain's been on vacation
for a week, so don't hold me to it...

I tried your suggestion, but to no avail, Xsun doesn't seem to pick up my
.keytable file.

I then tried a different approach. The file
/usr/openwin/etc/keytables/keytable.map determines which keytable to use,
given the keyboard type and keyboard layout. For example, 0,0 gives US4.kt,
4,4 gives Denmark4.kt etc. Since I dont know which keyboard type and layout
my keyboard returns, I just replaced all of the *.kt with Norway6.kt, i.e.,
regardless of the type and layout, Norway6.kt would be used. That did the
trick; the keyboard now behaved as a real Norwegian keyboard, even giving
me the \oslash and \aring on the command line. (BTW, I tried Norway4.kt
and Norway5.kt first. They were really bad; only the number keys seemed to
work.)

This is a crude method, but it works. I would like to find out which type
and layout my keyboard returns and then only update that one line in
keytable.map, that will be the subject of another posting to this group.

Thanks for your tips.

kbd -t can provide the type, but not the layout.

The next Solaris version (whatever it will be called)
will provide an "-l" option to kbd:

$ kbd -l
type=4
layout=34 (0x22)

Hi!

Sun Ultra 5 running Solaris 2.8 with Recommended and Security patch cluster
from July 2003 applied.

The machine uses the correct, US/English keyboard layout in console mode
and in the dtlogin screen (old keyboard was a German one... but that was
assassinated with little help from Pepsi, Inc.) ... but when the user
loggs in, he has a German keyboard layout (a horror if someone uses the
screen lock and has '#' and 'ß' in his/her password... xx@@!!!) ... does
anyone have an idea what may cause this problem (there is no file like
~/.key* in ${HOME}) ?

See the thread on this similar issue, where I had a server with a Danish
keyboard, but used a US layout. Confusion indeed, but now I have the tools
to set use exactly the keyboard layout I want in CDE, see below.

Subject: keyboard conundrum

I'm trying to remap a USB keyboard, to allow for a few "missing" keys.
The pipe key does not work by default.
It does not work either on console mode, or in Xwindows.

I can manually use xmodmap to add a mapping for keycode 57. however, I'd
like the system itself to have a "proper" keymap for it.
I've looked in /usr/openwin/share/etc/keytables, but none of the entries
seem to actually be used.

I say this, because according to xev, the backspace key is keycode 49.
however, grepping through the files in the keytables dir above, there is
no file that maps keyboard 49 to backspace. yet, backspace actually works
and gives the right keysym!

So, i would really like to know,

1. where the "real" openwin keytable for this hardware combination is
   coming from

2. where the coresponding console-level keytable is.
   I've looked at loadkeys, and associated manpage. But all it says is
   that /usr/share/lib/keytables/type_[tt]/layout_[dd] gets used.

  where tt is keyboard type and dd is layout number

  However, kbd -t does not return any meaningful type number, relating to
  the type_xx directories. So there is some serious lacking in the
  documentation here.
  [It says "USB keyboard"]


Technically, this is on solaris x86, if it makes a difference.
This is on a Fujitsu Celsius Mobile H laptop

It would be really nice if there were some console equivalent to xev,too.

So in theory, if xev shows the backspace key is X keycode 49, and then
since US6.kt.Z shows  42 RN XK_BackSpace, then the offset is 7

I shall give that a try. Thanks.

[huh. using that math, since xev says 'bar' aka pipe, is keycode 57,
then that means the keytable for this keyboard would need an entry for
it at 50, whereas US6 has it at 49. off-by-one, durn :-/ ]

Do you know of any precompiled, with-the-os way to probe the keyboard
to find out the "layout" value?  Otherwise, if you have some source
for a util lying around, it would be nice if you posted it. I want to
know which entry for keytable.map I'm going to have to override for
this thing.

Or is the layout set only via kdmconfig, on x86? If so, where is it
stored?

I can't find where kdmconfig is getting its list of keyboards from.
oh, waitaminit. seems that I have to create 
    devdata/keyboards/somename.kbd
AND add an entry to devdata/iddbdir/keyboards.idb, 
AND then add an entry for keytables/keytable.map
AND the copy and modify US6.kt.Z to somename.kt.Z

ugh.

For some locales you can use XIM (X Input method), alternatively there
are the Alt-Graph-key combinations (I can't find the page at
docs.sun.com anymore which had the nice ASCII chart incl. Altgr key
combinations) and finally there is

Subject: Re: Searching for some xterm help


According to  <lvirden@yahoo.com>:
:I am seeking some insight on defining an XTerm keyboard mapping problem.
:
:The problem is this - xmodmap -pk reports the following:
:
:     81         0xff50 (Home)

:I want to know what has to be done so that keyboard translations for
:F27 and F33 appear on the keyboard.  Right now, it appears that the
:0xff50 and 0xff57 keysyms are 'overriding' the other keysyms translation
:by default.


The solution to this was in the MIT X documentation.

The xterm translations are set from more specific to less specific.
By the time that the translations for F27 and F33 were reached, the
definitions for Home and End had already been set.  So since something
is assigning the Home and End keysyms to both pairs of keys, the first
translation took precedence over the second.

The solution was to define the F27 and F33 translations before the Home
and End ones--then I got unique sequences for the two pairs of keys
in xterm.

Apparently this works automatically with Sun's USB keybooards, because
they indentify with an USB country code of "DE", or something like
that.

PC USB keyboards (and this probably includes your PS/2 -> USB device)
don't define an USB country code so the system uses the default of "us
english" layout.

On Solaris x86, the same problem exists and is solved by running
/etc/init.d/keymap (linked to /etc/rcS.d/S33keymap.sh) early at system
startup, and this script run /usr/lib/set_keyboard_layout.

The set_keyboard_layout script is not included with Solaris SPARC, but
is exactly what you need to tell the USB keyboard driver to use
a keyboard layout != english.


To set the USB keyboard to a "German" keyboard layout,
set_keyboard_layout runs the command loadkeys with the undocumented
"-s" option:

      /usr/bin/loadkeys -s 9

The loadkeys command should work with USB keyboards on Solaris SPARC.

Valid layout codes for the "loadkeys -s" option can be found in
/usr/share/lib/keytables/type_6/layout_*

Subject: Mad Xsun uses German keyboard layout for US/UNIX keyboard...

Hi!

----

Solaris 2.8/SPARC with a US/UNIX keyboard, Xsun uses a german keyboard
layout (for example, 'y' and 'z' swapped) _after_ user login (_before_
login, e.g. at dtlogin screen and console (correctly) uses US/UNIX
keyboard layout).

I've ran Richard L. Hamilton's nice keyboard debugging tool (see
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=vsuaheef8bmm9b%40corp.supernews.com&output=gplain)
and got the following output:

Then I modified "keyboard.map" logged out, restarted dtlogin and
logged-in - no change.

Is there anything in the Solaris installation procedure (Solaris2.8
06/03) which may save the keyboard type present at installation time for
later usage (original keyboard was a german one, later I replaced it
with the US/UNIX one) ?

No, there is no record saved of the keyboard type.

Try logging in as another user and see if the problem persists.

You can also, as a test, try a non-graphical session, as that will use
another set of translation tables (/usr/share/lib/keytables).

I say this is most likely something in the user's environment messing
up the keyboard.

You will, AFAIK, use the same tables both at the dtlogin screen and
after login, unless the user has a personal .keytable or mucks with
xmodmap.

Cheers,
Thomas

Did you try -

# kbd -s german


PC keyboards does not report language type to the OS;
this is why  you have to tell WinXP  which keyboard
type you have.

Solaris SPARC recognize keyboard layout of a Sun-made keyboard,
since the sun USB keyboard does report locale variant.

Right, Mode_switch is the keysym for AltGraph, to switch international

AltGraph 4 to get the Euro symbol.   (Which is why the Euro is on the
right side of the 4 key on recent Sun keyboards.   On other layouts, it
activates other keysyms printed on the right side of the keys, like the
cyrillic letters on a Russian keyboard.)

Only if you want the serial port to be the system console.

If you don't need the serial port to be the system console
(it's just an ordinary terminal port), you can simply turn
on a login service on the port and log in.

If you do need the serial port to be the console, but you want
the screen and keyboard to continue as an ordinary graphics
terminal, then follow the procedure in Infodoc 18318 on
sunsolve.sun.com.

The difference between being the system console and an ordinary
terminal is that the system console gets the boot messages when
booting, and the "ok" prompt when shutting down or halting Solaris.
An ordinary terminal does not.

The DEC 3000/300 series will communicate with the serial console port if
it detects that there is no keyboard plugged into the system.  There is no
switch on this system to select the console mode.  The serial console port
is a 6-pin MMJ (Modified Modular Jack) connector.  These were standard for
DEC serial ports for a while, but they are virtually unknown on modern PC
hardware.

To connect a keyboard and mouse, you need an adapter cable.  The cable
plugs into the system, and the keyboard and mouse plug into the other end
of the adapter cable.

There are wireless (PC) USB keyboard / mouse devices.  The Ultra 10
and 60 don't have on-board USB support, but if you're using Solaris 8
or newer, you could add a PCI USB host controller card to get some USB
ports for the wireless USB keyboard / mouse (e.g. using an USB 2.0
card with the NEC chipset; you need a card with OHCI USB 1.1 support,
for Solaris SPARC).

To use an USB keyboard and/or mouse with a SPARC system that does
not have USB support in the bootprom, you have to setup two 
variables in /etc/system, telling the system the physical device
path for the USB keyboard and/or mouse, like this:

  set consconfig:usb_kb_path="/pci@1f,4000/pci@4/pci9710,35@6,1/keyboard@5"
  set consconfig:usb_ms_path="/pci@1f,4000/pci@4/pci9710,35@6/mouse@4"

Possible problems with such a setup:

- You probably can't enter the OBP on an Ultra 10 / 60 using an USB
  keyboard (because the boot prom does not support USB keyboards).

Another possible problem with an USB keyboard on Solaris SPARC:
A PC USB keyboard often does not return a valid keyboard layout code,
so the Solaris kernel modules will use the default US-English layout.
This can be fixed by running "/usr/bin/loadkeys -s $LAYOUT", using the
appropriate layout code.

        Good price -- but you will probably want a keyboard, unless you
set up another computer to run a terminal program and connect to serial
port 'A'.  With no keyboard, it will *only* talk to serial port 'A'
(TTYA) no matter what framebuffers (graphics cards) and monitors you
have.  The default settings for TTYA should be:

        ttya-rts-dtr-off=false
        ttya-ignore-cd=true
        ttya-mode=9600,8,n,1,-

These settings are in the OBP (Open Boot PROM), and can be (and may have
been) changed.  If so, you'll have to try various data/bps rates and other
settings until you get one which works.

        The keyboard is unique to Sun -- at least with that connector
and some of the extra keys present.

Especially *avoid* using a keyboard labeled "Solbourne".  It uses the
same connector, but a different pinout, and plugging in that keyboard
will blow a non-replaceable fuse on the system board.

        Just about any Sun keyboard offered on eBay which is not marked
"USB" should work.  Type 5 or type 6 would probably be the best choices.

        From the Sun FEH (Field Engineer's Handbook):

1.      The minimum memory requirement os two DIMMS in any bank.

        (The two sockets closest to the board edge are "bank 0",
        the other two "bank 1"

        Choices are 32, 64, 128, and 255 MB DIMMs.

        Actually -- for that, I would use OpenBSD instead.  Less load
	on the CPU, and it makes a great firewall using PF (Packet Filter)
	which comes as part of it.  But Linux would probably be less of
	a load than Solaris 10 at least.  (And Solaris 8 is the earliest
	which will run with it.)

        There were two different families of system boards.  These are
	the possible barcodes on a label on the board.  (Note that
	the '-' is probably not present, so look for one which starts
	with 375; the next four digits tell which version it is,

Board           Possible CPU speed
==================================================
375-0009        300 or 330 MHz.
375-0066        333/360 MHz
375-0079        333/360/440 MHz
375-0115        360/440 MHz

        CPU modules:
        Ultra 5
501-4477        270 MHz
501-5039        270 MHz

        Ultra 10
501-4379        300 MHz
501-5040        300 MHz

        Ultra 5 & 10
501-5090        333 MHz
501-5568        333 MHz

        I don't see what keeps a CPU for one from working in the other
	system.  Anyway -- look for a barcode on the system board to
	identify it (including how it was likely to have been originally
	shipped), and look for a barcode on the CPU module to see how
	fast it is.

	(There were 256 K Cache boards in the early lot, and 2 MB Cache
	boards in the later ones.

        Look for the FEH pages for the system barcode which you have,
but they are not very different, and unless you need to update the FLASH
to get a more recent OPB (Open Boot Prom) installed, you are unlikely to
have to change any jumpers.  It is not like a Windows box, where you
have to change jumpers to tell it how much RAM it has.  These self
analyze and configure.

	However -- the jumper blocks which are documented for the 
	first of the boards in the FEH are:

        Go back to the Sun site, and search for:

Yes, they are. The U10 uses standard EDO DIMMs and not SDRAM (which is
what PC133 is). While not very common in PCs EDO DIMMs were quite common
in old Pentium2/3 XEON-based servers.

Yes, but your expectations regarding file server performance should not
be very high. The U10 was already a low cost design when it came out.

You basically replace an OS that perfectly supports the U10's hardware
with something that might work good enough but under the hood is more of
a mess.

No, they just decided that producing 440MHzs models only is silly and
thus made models with other clock speeds as well ;-)

No, U10 is single processor only.

FYI: If you have Solaris on a Sun SunFire V240 that cannot start the
X Windows environment, it could be caused by the USB mouse.  We were
able to get past this by unplugging the mouse when the console says
"watchdog" and then plug it back in again.

Not directly.  :-(  But one of my contacts within Sun did point me
to an internal survey about "input device requirements".  Not only
did I tell them what I felt, I also posted the URL here (with
permission, of course), and encouraged others to do likewise.

I guess only time will tell if we kicked up enough fuss...

Agreed.  I use at least some of the left hand keys all the time
(e.g., Front, Open, Copy, and Paste).

I don't know about the attachment requirements, but  yes, if it's
technically doable, a mouse that plugs directly into the keyboard
is a must.

The fact that peecees, to this day, still don't attach the mouse to 
the keyboard is proof that in peecee land, mice were an afterthought.
I don't recall seeing a Sun with a mouse that didn't plug into the
keyboard, EVER, right back to the 3/50s.  Except for the Type 6
travesty, which was a big step backwards in many ways.

Strange.

But the USB keyboard is usable to enter and use the BIOS setup
screens, and it's also usable in the Solaris DCA (until the Solaris
kernel is loader and running), and probably also when you boot from an
MSDOS floppy?  This would be an indication of enabled USB keyboard
legacy support.

I've seen systems where the BIOS USB -> PS/2 keyboard and mouse legacy
emulation works inside Solaris, when the X11 server is up and running.

Maybe you have to change some more BIOS settings, so that Solaris
believes there's a PS/2 keyboard/mouse, e.g. you may have to set "PS/2
keyboard/mouse function" from "auto" to "enabled" so that the ACPI
and/or PnP information reports a PS/2 keyboard/mouse, even though no
PS/2 keyboard/mouse is attached to the system.

In the Solaris DCA screen with the list of detected hardware, is there
a PS/2 keyboard / mouse listed?

> Does it mean that I have to use PS/2 mouse and keyboard?

Well, there's zero support for USB peripherals when there's no
Solaris driver for the USB host controller.

It doesn't.  It wouldn't be hard to make it do that, but I'm not fond
of doing Sun Ray-specific hacks that then lead to Sun Ray-specific
stuff embedded in applications.  If there was, say, an X.org or
freedesktop.org standard that Sun Ray (and everyone else) could follow
then that'd be a different matter.

In the absence of an existing property-based standard the best solution
would be for Sun Ray to support the X Keyboard Extension, which lets
you do everything you'd ever dream of doing with a keyboard and then
some.  I'd hoped SRSS 3.0 would support XKB but it doesn't.  I have my
fingers crossed that XKB support will get into the next release.

Until something along those lines happens I don't know of any way of
discovering what keyboard is being used on a Sun Ray.

BTW, the notion of "the" keyboard is a little slippery on Sun Ray, for
a couple of reasons.  The first is that you can have several keyboards
plugged in at the same time.  The DDX merges the input from those
multiple keyboards into a single logical keyboard stream.  Probably
the best it could do for the purposes of this discussion would be to
report a keyboard change each time it accepted input from a new
keyboard, or perhaps when it accepted input from a keyboard whose
layout was suspected to be different from the previous keyboard.

The other is the existential question of "what keyboard is plugged
in to a Sun Ray session that is not currently attached to a Sun Ray
unit?".  I suppose it'd keep reporting whatever keyboard was in use
at the time the session became unattached, then report a change (if
necessary) the next time the session became attached to a unit.
Reporting "no keyboard" would probably confuse apps that care about
this kind of thing, assuming there's even a way to do that under XKB.

Subject: Solaris 10 Keyboard questions

2 questions:

1: SunBlade 150, Solaris 10 - when using a "standard" Compaq USB keyboard, 
it works until it sits idle for some time, then in order to wake it up, the 
USB connector must be pulled and re-inserted. Is it possible to change 
settings, install driver, etc to get these non-Sun keyboards to work 
consistantly? BTW, the keyboards work fine on SunBlade 150, Solaris 8.

2. Ultra 5/10 series, Solaris 8/10 - The keyboards here are not the PS/2 
type. When disconnecting the keyboard, the machine immediately drops out
to "ok" prompt. Is it possible to use a non-Sun keyboard here (with eye
to implementing a kvm settup), or is there a way to implement kvm without 
resorting to manually disabling and re-enabling the keyboard, then 
physically moving the keyboard connector to the other machine.

There are sun-compatible KVM manufacturers that will not cause the SPARC
to abort when the host is switched.

Thanks for the reply.

There are no events reported when moving rollerball.

Just a question, is the problem related to the fact that there is
only one USB device which is common for both keyboard and rollerball?

If so, how can one change the "input device" to work with only one device?

Subject: PS/2 PC keyboard on to Sun E220R ?

I have an old E220R, and the Sun keyboard is broken. 

Furthermore, I could not figure out the exact combination of cables and
adapters to attach the E220R (DB-25 on serial A, but the cable that I have
has an RJ-45 on the other end) to a PC so that I can run minicom from a
linux box to login via the serial console.

So can I use a PC-type of keyboard and mouse and attach it to the E220R ?
I found these 2:

1) ==============================

Question is:

Does it matter what system board they are attached to ? That is, can they be
used on other systems apart from the E220R ?

Hi Erlend,

Thanks that's exaclty what I was doing, reading the hardware manual,
when I found about the ALOM port.

AFAIK, if they have the same keycode (not keysym!), they also have
the same hardware scancode, so there would be no way to tell them
apart without modifying the keyboard, and I have no info as to how or
whether that might be feasible.

Presumably there are multiple keyboard layouts made using mostly the
same hardware and only a different PROM and keycaps.  Although on the
pre-USB keyboards, one could distinguish them, and the blank key was
potentially useful since no existing software assigned it a meaning.
I don't know whether not having them different on the USB keyboards
was an oversight or whether it was some sort of side effect of complying
with the standards for USB keyboards, or maybe intentional for some other
reason that I can't guess.

Double hoorray for these! Just wondering, are they considering radio

        I'm not familiar with the V880 systems, but anything with USB
sockets probably does not use the older Sun keyboard connector.  If the
connector is on the framebuffer, then it is likely that it is intended
to be used with a video eyepiece which alternately turns off one eye or
the other on alternate frames -- thus giving 3D images.

        First -- look *carefully* at the connector on the framebuffer
and the one on the keyboard and make sure that they have compatible pin
locations.  Then, look up the framebuffer data in the FEH (or in the
copy held at the Sunshack site in Australia) assuming that the board is
old enough.

        After all -- you don't want to zap the framebuffer or the
keyboard.  Sun Type-6 keyboards are available with the older connector,
or the newer USB connector.  I'm typing this on one of the latter on a
Sun Blade 2000.

        Note that plugging in the USB keyboard *after* the system has
booted will probably not do much of anything.  It must be present to be
probed during boot.

        And -- FWIW -- I'm using a Sun Type-6 USB keyboard on a Mac
Mini, so I can tell you that they are quite compatible -- though the Sun
keyboard may have more keys.

        Good Luck,

This simply means that the serial port is being used by some other
process.  Another message that means the same thing is "all ports busy".

(Also, make sure you are using the cable that the APC UPS requires;
probably not what is happening here, as if that were the case, the
message would probably be "no device" or something like that.)

sac will respawn, according to it's entry in /etc/inittab, so just

Couple things, in order of importance:

1.If there is NO keyboard attached to the system, your console is port
"A" (default Sparc behaviour when booting up w/o a Sun KB attached).
This means that you WILL NOT be able to use ttya for anything else. (Not
recommended to remove your inittab entry for the console)

2.pmadm -l and see if there is a port monitor (login service) running on
the port.  If there, remove with: pmadm -r -p zsmon -s ttya

3.ISTR from past experiences with the APC daemon that is tends to
monitor any and all serial ports, not just the ones you ask it to (or
perhaps that's a default behaviour).  See #5 below.

4.ps -ef|grep defunct  If you have defunct processes in your process
table, they could be from past failed attempts to use or monitor the
serial port and only a reboot will clear them.

5.fuser -u /dev/cua/a fuser -u /dev/ttya

If you get any output from those commands (will show up as numbers
followed by an "o", grep those numbers through your process table and
see what process has them and kill it.

6. Finally, are you certain port 'a' is operable?  Have you used it in the
past?  A failing or failed serial port will often act in this manner.

HTH!

Subject: Sun keyboard protocol

I've just bought an Ultra 5 off eBay. I don't have a Sun keyboard, but
I've read that it communicates over something like RS232 at TTL levels.
So, can I just put a MAX232 between the serial port on my PC and the Sun
keyboard port, and write a program to translate the data?

If so, does anyone have good info on the keyboard protocol/codes?

Thanks
David

It's not quite that straight forward.  Get a Sun keyboard (and mouse);
they're very cheap, and great qaulity too (if you get the Type 5 one;
avoid the Type 6).

Why would you do that (not that it would work)? Why don't you just
hookup a serial cable straight into the serial port, and since there
is no keyboard connected, you'll have full console right there for no work?
Console over serial has worked on Sun workstations for several decades.

>If so, does anyone have good info on the keyboard protocol/codes?

There's some copies floating available, or the original source is the SPARC
internataional website, which probably still charges for the spec,
much like any of the other spec (ie. recent IEEE standards) places do.

Or, pay the $2.99 that a type-5 Sun keyboard goes for on eBay.

Hi All,

I wish Sun keyboard went that cheap in the UK ebay, moree like $35/40
dollars overhere inc delivery

You could also try a Sun Adapter from Belkin, i have one but unfortunately
does not seem to work; i am getting another one; if it does not work, the
nit may be the cable, but i will know for sure when i get a hold of a Sun
keyboard at some point the the next week.

So i think you would be best to get a Keyboard and a sun monitor adaptor as
well that way you can use the local graphics engine and avoid and network
traffic to display remote graphical sessions and also be able to get a root
login on the graphical side without to much effort.


Thanks, Graeme

You didn't look very hard, did you?

They seem to go from GBP4.99 to GBP10.00. A search for "Sun keyboard"
on ebay.co.uk found 7.

Other options include:

        - Make sure you run Solaris 10 or later (if running Solaris)
        - get a USB card (for $10, most any will work)
        - get a USB keyboard.

Drawback: no output on boot, serial console output only until multiuser.

You mean grave accent (`), not acute accent (´).

"C" locale means US-ASCII.

There are *no* special characters like  é à ç  in US-ASCII.

In Solaris Express on Desktop Preferences->.Keyboard it is possible simply
to choose a languages' layouts and icon will appear in right side panel,
you can change a language either clicking by mouse on icon or pressing
a key-conbination on keyboard. In S10 you can choose a Layouts in the
same place but nobody will happen, nor icon appear in Panel, nor
becomes clear what key-combination to press for changing of layout.

Subject: cannot change keyboard mapping in Xorg 1.5

Hi there,

I recently did upgrade from opensolaris snv 106 to snv 107. This did
upgrade the Xorg version to 1.5. Unfortunately my keyboard mapping is
english now, I am unable to change it back to german. IRC channel in
freenode suggested to change the mapping using the Gnome Input methode
but this is already set to german. I googled that issue and found among
others this URL
http://opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=90911&tstart=0 but this
  did not solve my problem.

Is someone running Opensolaris snv 107 with other then english keyboard
mapping in Xorg and how was this configured?

Thank you for advice! Have a nice day!

Andreas

Yes I have/had also problems. The first one for me was, that the intel
driver does not work, so I had to switch over to the VEAS driver.

The German-keyboard was also missing, but can be available via
configuration in the xorg.conf

see

    http://blogs.sun.com/alanc/entry/xorg_1_5_3_in

Here are the entries for the keyboard described.

Thank you for that info;  one comment states that the guest additions in
Virtual Box do not work with the new Xorg server. I need them! Therefore
probably I will wait until snv_109.

Thank you. I'll take a look at that next time the machine goes up the creeks.
The tool appears to auto detect the keyboard correctly, as being a UK keyboard.

The machine was bought new, with the right (type 7) keyboard and mouse, so
I'm not using some older unsupported keyboard.

Subject: Solaris 10 keyboard / hid driver

Hi there.  I've been given the task of investigating and, later,
implementing a Solaris 10 (SPARC, if it matters) keyboard driver
"replacement" that will catch a specific sequence -- akin to
"ctrl-alt-del" -- and allow us to take a particular action when that
combo is received.

I've read the bolthole information for drivers, and also poked through
Sun's documents and some of the OpenSolaris code, but I'm not sure I'm
much the better for it.

For example, I see that there is more than one driver specifically for
the keyboard:

# modinfo | grep kbd
 80  1376a20   27a8  16   1  conskbd (conskbd multiplexer driver 5.58)

#: modinfo | grep key
 81  1378da0   4280   -   1  kbtrans (kbtrans (key translation) 1.37)
 94  13d4470   1eb4   -   1  usbkbm (USB keyboard streams 1.37)

# modinfo | grep hid
 91  13cc660   3748  51   1  hid (USB HID Client Driver 1.38)
 92  13cf3d0   32f0   -   1  hidparser (HID PARSER 1.14)

So, obviously, this isn't a case of "update this one driver and slap
it in there with add_drv".  Has anyone done something similar to
this?  Any tales to share after the trip?  Suggestions?  ("Drink more
booze" is being considered as we speak...)

Much obliged...

Aaron
