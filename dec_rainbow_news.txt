The Digital Equipment Corporation "Rainbow" Personal Computer

A machine with an 8086 processor, which originally ran CP/M-86 but
which was later revamped (with motherboard mods) to run a version of
MS-DOS, but which was not fully hardware compatible with the IBM PC.

The Kramden Utilities (how did they get THAT name?) include some useful stuff.

If Suitable Solutions is still in business, maybe you can get MS-DOS V3.10b and
Code Blue from them.  That would handle questions 1 and 3.

Go to your local software store and purchase "Lost Treasures of Infocom" and 
"Lost Treasures of Infocom II" in floppy disk form, not CD-ROM form.  Take them 
to a some IBMPCclone with a 1.2M 5-1/4 floppy drive and the RX50 device driver
software installed.  Copy the Infocom disks onto Rainbow-formatted floppies
and then install the games on your Rainbow.  Some run straight.  Some require
Code Blue.  One of the dozens of games you will have actually won't run on the
Rainbow because it uses IBMPC CGA.

The Turbo-C V2.00 compiler from Borland definitely works with Code Blue and the
resulting code typically runs native.  I've read of others making Turbo-C V2.00
run in native mode on the Rainbow, but I never succeeded in that.  My MSC V3 
works wonderfully on my Rainbow.  Once you have a C compiler, you can convert 
many applications intended Unix, IBMPCcloneMS-DOS, or other systems.  Or roll 
your own.

In honor of the VMS dollar sign, I use the cent sign for a command prompt.  
If you'd like a copy of that line from my autoexec.bat, ask.

The color version of the Pro 350 requires the video board plus the extended
video board to provide the other two "color planes" (combined the two give
RGB).  You appear to have only the video board (i.e. mono only).

Curiously enough I've found the two cables are not actually compatible.  The
Pro does work with a Rainbow cable but not visa versa.  The colors are also
flakey (if you had color) using a Rainbow video cable.

> I assume that since it worked, I have a monochrome Pro, but could it be

The color system also can run a mono monitor (sync on green and mono video
lines).  If I understand correctly the mono monitor is running off the +12V
supply on the Pro itself, while a VR241 monitor is of course stand-alone
with a separate 110V plug.

This is titled "CT100 Video Generator" and is numbered 001002.  You also
need "CT100 Color Bitmap" numbered 001403.  It has an over-the-top 40 pin
BERG connector between the two.

If you can handle a soldering iron and a meter, then you can do a quick hack
like this (totally unaproved of by DEC of course).

Start off with a 15 pin D connector of the right gender to fit the monitor end
of the cable (I think you need a plug), and a 4-pin RJ11 (I think) to take the
keyboard cable.

Now : 

link pins 7 and 8 on the 15 pin D (+12V out)
link pins 4,5,6,13 on the 15 pin D (ground)

Looking into the face of the RJ11, with the pins towards you, number the
leftmost pin 1.

Now link as follows:

RJ11 pin 1 to pin 14 of the D
RJ11 pin 2 to +12V
RJ11 pin 3 to Ground
RJ11 pin 4 to pin 15 of the D

You should check those connections between the D connector and the RJ11 on your
existing VR201, in case I've noted them down wrongly

Now you need to find a composite mono monitor, capable of handling the USA TV
scan frequencies. Such monitors are relatively common, nut are not used with
PCs (except as a mono monitor on a CGA card I guess). Now find a video lead to
fit the monitor input, connect it's sheild to ground on the 15 pin D plug, and
the inner to pin 12.

Plug everything in, and it should work.

The Rainbow uses a BCC17 cable with the VR241 color monitor, NOT the BCC03
cable used by the Professional, DECmate, and VT241 terminal.

Here in the United States, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) is selling
the BCC17-6 cable for $56 US.

======================
BCC03 and BCC17 cables
======================

The following data was extracted from the PDP-11 Systems And Options Catalog,
October - December 1984 (DEC part number ED-26049-41), page 4-19.

The cables consist of three 30 AWG coax cables and four 20-AWG stranded
conductors with a 38 AWG tinned copper braid shield.  The connectors are:

    P1 = 15 position D subminiature
    P2 = keyboard plug
    P3 = "B" BNC
    P4 = "G" BNC
    P5 = "R" BNC
    
The wiring is:

    P1-1  -- P3 coax shield
    P1-2  -- P4 coax shield
    P1-3  -- P5 coax shield
    P1-4  -- --------------
    P1-5  -- P1-13 jumper
    P1-6  -- P2-3 conductor
    P1-7  -- --------------
    P1-8  -- P2-2 conductor
    P1-9  -- P3 coax center
    P1-10 -- P4 coax center in BCC03 only -- nothing in BCC17
    P1-11 -- P5 coax center
    P1-12 -- P4 coax center in BCC17 only -- nothing in BCC03
    P1-13 -- P1-5 jumper
    P1-14 -- P2-1 conductor
    P1-15 -- P2-4 conductor


Rainbow keyboard / monitor connector (J3)
=========================================
The following pin assignments for the Rainbow keyboard/monitor connector were
extracted from "PC100 Mother Board" skematic (DEC drawing size D, code CS,
number 5415486-0-1, revision E) which is included in the "PC100 Field
Maintenance Print Set (DEC part number MP-01491-00).   The assignments are 
also listed in the Rainbow 100 Technical Manual (DEC part number
EK-PC100-TM-001); table 3-6 on page 3-22 except that table shows the keyboard
data flowing in directions opposite that shown on the schematic and listed
below.

The BCC02 monochrome cable wiring was obtained by inspecting that cable.
BCC03 and BCC17 cable wiring was from the source listed above.

                                    BCC02  BCC03  BCC17  Possible

Conclusion
==========

Comparison of the above data suggests that when the graphics board is in a
Rainbow, the BCC03 cable should route the color graphics signals to the VR241
monitor.  However, the monochrome signal generated on the Rainbow's
motherboard will NOT be capable of being displayed with the BCC03 cable.

As indicated in the "Rainbow Color/Graphics Option Programmer's Reference
Guide" (DEC part number AA-AE36A-TV), the Rainbow can support three different
monitor configurations:

 (1) monochrome monitor only
 (2) color monitor only
 (3) both monochrome and color monitors

Each of the single monitor configurations presents a problem, that is how to
get graphics video data to the monochrome monitor, and how to get motherboard
video data to the color monitor.  DEC solved these problems with a electronic
switch on the motherboard.  That switch is controlled by bit 2 of port 0A
hexidecimal.  Setting that bit to 0 places motherboard video data on pin 12
of the BCC02 / BCC17 cable.  In contrast, setting the bit to 1 puts graphics
option "green" data on that pin.

To my knowledge, DEC never sold a cable to support the Rainbow's dual monitor
configuration.  However, some people have built such a cable.

(Note: The above data suggests a Professional or DECmate, when equipped with
its graphics option and an appropriate cable, may also be capable of supporting
a dual monitor configuration.)

Well, there is finally some good news, I think, for all those people out 
there with old fixed frequency large screen monitors, left over from 
workstations (VAX or DEC), and who want to use them on a PC.

This has always been a problem because of the fixed frequency aspect.  
DEC used to sell an ISA board for $2000 but that was excessive.

Send email to Emil Darmo at Mirage (mirage@lainet.com), which is a 
company that makes both VLB and PCI cards for handling these monitors.
