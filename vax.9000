Actually, it wasn't a good product.  Even back at Decus in Atlanta (was
that '91 or '92?), the 9000 was discussed in the "lemon" presentation.

The 9000 never delivered on its promised performance specs for time-sharing
environments.  For scientific number-crunching applications it performed
rather well, although short-lived.

The reliability was never there with the 9000 - the 6xxx and 7xxx systems
have always been far more reliable here.  Digital sunk way too dollars into
the project trying to sell this is as mainframe, when all it really was was
just another Vax (although 15' long!).  I can't remember how much time
Digital spent here planning for its installation - certainly far more than
was called for.

I'm sure glad ours is long gone...
