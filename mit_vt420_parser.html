Compatability And Portability Of the Parser:</A>
</H2><P>
VTPARSER is written completely in ANSI C to guarantee its compatibility
with different platforms and C compilers. Please, note that the
program allows using PASCAL-style function calls. For that purpose
&quot;PASCAL&quot; is defined as &quot;pascal&quot; in VTPARSER.
For your compiler you might need to change the definition of PASCAL
or define PASCAL to nothing. You may also want to change the definitions
of the data types according to the operating system for which
the code is to be complied. If you decide to redefine the data
type for your operating system, the only requirement for the size
of the data-types is to be not smaller than the standard associated
with the mnemonic allows.
<P>
In order to use this VTParser within your applications, you will
need to include VT420.H header file.
<hr>
<H2><p align=center><A NAME="Functions">Functions available to the application:</A></h2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="InitializeParser"><CODE>PS PASCAL InitializeParser( void );</CODE></A><br>
Before you make any calls to the parser, you
will need to call <CODE>InitializeParser</CODE>, which allocates a parser control
block (parser structure--PS) and returns a pointer to it. Each PS structure
completely defines a parser's state and is passed as an argument to every
parser-related function. Therefore, any number of independent applications can
parse the data concurrently using the same code, but distinct
PS blocks.
<p>
<LI><A NAME="ParseAnsiData"><CODE>void PASCAL ParseAnsiData( const PS, const LPSES pSesptr, const
LPSTR lpData, const PA_INT iDataLen );</CODE></A><br>
This is the main parser's function.  Here, <var>pSesptr</var> is any pointer
internal to your program (it will
not be processed and is passed along to <CODE>ProcessAnsi</CODE> function).
<var>lpData</var> is a pointer to a buffer containing the data to be parsed,
and <var>iDataLen</var> is the length of that buffer. The next time <CODE>ParseAnsiData</code>
is called, it assumes that the new data is the continuation of
the previous one. The data may end in the middle of an escape
sequence. In that case, the command associated with the escape
sequence will be generated after the end of the sequence is found
during the next time <code>ParseAnsiData</code> is called.
<P>
When <CODE>ParseAnsiData</CODE> encounters a character, an ASCII command (for
example <tt>TAB</tt>, <tt>CR</tt>, <tt>LF</tt>, et.) or successfully parses an escape sequence,
it calls function <CODE>ProcessAnsi</CODE>.
<p>
<LI><A NAME="ProcessAnsi"><CODE>void PASCAL ProcessAnsi( LPSES pSesptr, PA_INT iCode );</CODE></A><br>
Here, <var>pSesptr</var> is the pointer passed to <CODE>ParseAnsiData</CODE>. If <var>iCode</var>
is greater than 0 and less than 256, it is the ASCII code of a
character to print or an ASCII function. If iCode &gt;= 256, it
is a VT command. All the arguments, if required, are stored in
the PS block. If <var>ps</var> is defiend as,
<P><A NAME="PS">
<CODE>PS ps;</CODE></A>
<P>
then the arguments are stored in an integer <var>(PS_INT)</var> array ps-&gt;iArgs.
The array consists of <var>VTPARAMS</var> (16) elements numbered from 0 to
<var>VTPARAMS-1</var> (15). NOTE: Neither the contents of <var>iArgs</var> array nor
the contents of the buffer or string passed to <code>ProcessAnsi</code> may
be modified by the application. The parser is expecting the contents
of PS blocks preserved except for some fields mentioned below.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="ResetParser"><CODE>void PASCAL ResetParser( const PS );</CODE></A><br>
If you want to reset the parser (cancel a pending escape sequence),
use <code>ResetProcessAnsiData</code> function.
A call to <code>ResetParser</code> will also cancel printer controller mode
and thus reactivate the parsing of the data stream.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="FlushParserBuffer"><CODE>void PASCAL FlushParserBuffer( const PS );</CODE></A><br>
In order to flush the buffer to the screen (to <code>ProcessAnsi</code>) and
reset the parser, you may use <code>FlushParserBuffer</code> function.
<code>FlushParserBuffer</code> will dump the buffer to the screen even if dumping
errors is off (see further).
<P>
<LI><A NAME="SwitchParserMode"><CODE>void PASCAL SwitchParserMode( const PS, const int iParserMode );</CODE></A><br>
If you want to switch VTxxx mode, use <code>SwitchParserMode</code>.
Here <var>iParserMode</var> is a mode defined in VTCONST.H. If <var>iParserMode</var>
is invalid, it is ignored. The default mode for Parser is VT420.
Note, the current mode can also be changed by an appropriate escape
sequence.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="ProcessSKIP"><code>void PASCAL ProcessSKIP( PS );</code></A><br>
<Code>ProcessSKIP</code> is a function that allows skipping till the end of a DCS
sequence.  For more information, look at <A HREF="#curdcs"><var>curdcs</var></A> variable.
</UL>

<A NAME="vars">PS structure's variables available to the application:</A></H2>
<h3>
<P align=center>
<A NAME="Read/Write">The following variables are available for READ/WRITE:</A></h3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="vterrorchar"><code>PA_INT vterrorchar = 168;</code></A> /* Upside-down question mark */<br>
Variable <var>vterrorchar</var> contains the value for what DEC calls an
&quot;error character&quot; that is passed as <var>iCode</var> to <code>ProcessAnsi</code>
when an invalid escape sequence is received or <tt>SUB</tt> is encountered
within an escape sequence. (HINT: Since <var>vterrorchar</var> is a PA_INT,
it does not have to be a character. If you don't want any error
character displayed, for example, make <var>vterrorchar</var> equal to DO__IGNORE.
Or you can use DO_BELL as your <var>vterrorchar</var>.)
<P>
<LI><A NAME="dumperror"><code>PA_BOOL dumperror = FALSE;</code></A> /* ignore errors. Don't dump them */<br>
Ignoring errors is the specified behavior for VT terminals. However,
dumping might prove useful for the debugging purposes.
</UL>
<p>
<h3>
<P align=center>
<A NAME="READ ONLY">The following variables are available for READ ONLY:</A></h3>
<p>
<h4>Please do NOT modify these variables, or the parser may become
unstable. To change the parser's mode do not modify <var>vtmode</var>, but
use <code>SwitchParserMode</code> instead.</h4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="pendingfunc"><code>PA_INT pendingfunc = NOFUNC;</code></A><br>
If <var>pendingfunc</var> is 0, the parser is in the initial state. Otherwise,
some is pending (not completely received). Use <code>ResetParser</code> to
reset to the initial state.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="prnctrlmode"><code>BOOL prnctrlmode = FALSE;</code></A><br>
If this variable is <tt>TRUE</tt>, it indicated parser in the printer controller
mode (or debug mode). In that mode the parser dumps every character
right to the output stream (<code>ProcessAnsi</code>) without the processing
(except <tt>XON</tt>/<tt>XOFF</tt> and the printer controller mode terminating sequences).
Use <code>ResetParser</code> to reset to the initial state.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="letCR"><code>BOOL letCR = FALSE;</code></A><br>
If this variable is <tt>TRUE</tt>, the parser is waiting for the filename
for an extended command (see VTCMND.H).
<P>
<LI><A NAME="largebuffer"><code>BOOL largebuffer = FALSE;</code></A><br>
If this variable is <tt>TRUE</tt>, the parser is using a large temporary
buffer. When the command it is parsing is completed, the buffer
will be freed and the normal small buffer will be reallocated.
Use <code>ResetParser</code> to quit the parsing of the current command, free
the extra memory, and reset to the initial state.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="curdcs"><code>void (PASCAL *curdcs)( PS ) = NULL;</code></A><br>
If curdcs is not <tt>NULL</tt>, the parser is processing a DCS-compliant
function. Use <code>ResetParser</code> to reset to the initial mode. However,
if you use <code>ResetParser</code>, DCS-compliant functions that usually call
<code>ProcessAnsi</code> to announce the termination (normal or abnormal) of
the DCS sequences will NOT announce the DCS sequence being terminated.
In order for the DCS-parsing function to announce an abnormal
termination, use <code>PARSER_TERMDCS( ps )</code> macro. Parameter <var>ps</var> is the
current PS block pointer. If there is no DCS sequence being parsed,
<code>PARSER_TERMDCS( ps )</code> does not have an effect. If you want to SKIP
the rest of the DCS sequence (till <tt>ST</tt> or any other condition that
would terminate DCS sequence), use
<A HREF="#ProcessSKIP"><code>ProcessSKIP</code></A> function.
<P>
If there was no DCS sequence pending, the results of <code>ProcessSKIP</code>
are undefined. Also, you must run <code>ResetParser</code> or <code>PARSER_TERMDCS(
ps )</code> BEFORE calling <code>ProcessSKIP</code>.

<h3><p align=center>VTCSI.T</h3>

or <tt>ESC [</tt>). The fields are: 
<br>
<b>&lt final character &gt;, &lt flag &gt;, &lt argtype &gt;,
&lt default &gt;, &lt command &gt;,</b>

Here the <final character> is its ASCII code. The flag is a bitwise
combination of flags as defined in the second table in VTTABLE.C.
<h4><p>&lt argtype &gt;:</h4>
<UL>
<LI>If <code><var>argtype</var> &lt PA_MAXARG</code>:<br>
Argtype defines the switch for the &lt command &gt. If there
exists switch 0, it is considered to be the default and is used
if the switch is omitted. The &lt default &gt is passed
as <var>iArgs[0]</var>. Note, there maybe many switches (<var>argtypes</var>) for the
same &lt final character &gt
and &lt flag &gt as long as <strong>each</strong> argtype &lt <tt>PA_MAXARGS</tt>.  If a "switchable" command
has more than one argument, it is called separately for each argument.
Unknown switches are ignored.
<P>
<LI>If <code>PA_MAXARG &lt <var>argtype</var> &lt= PA_MULTIARG</code>,<br>
The function accepts <code>( PA_PN1 - argtype + 1 )</code> arguments. If any of the arguments are missing or 0, a default value of
&lt default &gt is used. It is an error if the command contains more arguments than
<var>argtype</var> specifies. The
arguments are passed as <var>iArgs</var> array in PS block. <var>iArgs[0]</var> corresponds to the first argument; <var>iArgs[1]</var>, to the second, and so on.
<P>
<LI>If <code>PA_MAXARG == <var>argtype</var></code>:<br>
This is the same as the case above, except the number of the arguments
is taken to be the <strong>maximun</strong> number of the arguments (<tt>VTARGS</tt>) the parser can accept.
HINT: It might be useful if you want to fill all the unused arguments in <var>iArgs</tt> with
the &lt default &gt value (otherwise they are undefined).
<P>
<LI>If <code><var>argtype</var> &gt; PA_MULTIARG</code>:<br>
The function accepts <strong>groups</strong> of arguments. A group contains <code>( PA_PN1 - <var>argtype</var> + 1 + PA_MULTIARG )</code> arguments.
The arguments are passed and the &lt default &gt value is used in the
same way as before. The command is called as many times as there
are groups of arguments. Each time <var>iArgs[0]</var> is the first arguments
of the group, <var>iArgs[1]</var> is the second, and so on. HINT: You may
set <var>argtype</var> to define groups of one argument. This will allow
parsing the strings of unlimited number of arguments.

This file defines <tt>DCS</tt> sequences that are processed by the DCS-processing
functions. The fields are:<br>
<b>&lt final character &gt;, &lt flag &gt;, &lt dcs-processing function's name &gt;,</b>
<h4>Special Note:</h4>
<tt>DO__DIRECT</tt> is an internal for the parser command that stands for
VT52's Direct Cursor Positioning command. If it is present among
the escape sequence definitions, it can only be in VTE1xxxx.T
files.
<HR>
<h2><p align=center>Writing DCS-Processing Functions:</h2>
<P>
If you will be adding the processing for the new <tt>DCS</tt> sequences,
you will need to create your function to conform to DCS-processing
protocol. 
<P>
Because of the little similarity among the data strings of different
DCS commands, each one requires a separate function to be parsed.
Here is an overview of the DCS protocol used by this parser. To
be know as a DCS-compliant function, the function must:
<OL>
<LI>set <var>curdcs</var> field of PS block to itself
<p>
<LI>be able to process calls
to itself with <var>pendingstate</var> field of PS set to <tt>STTERM</tt> and <tt>NONSTTERM</tt>.
</OL>
The DCS-complaint functions are called with <var>pendingstate</var> field
of <tt>STTERM</tt> when <tt>ST</tt> character has been encountered by <code>getNextChar</code> or
<code>ProcessESC</code>, and <var>pendingstate</var> field of <tt>NONSTTERM</tt> when the parsing
of the <tt>DCS</tt> string has to terminate by any other reasons (<tt>CAN</tt>,
<tt>SUB</tt>, <tt>CSI</tt> commands, for example). When an <tt>STTERM</tt> call is made,
the last character in the PS buffer <code>pendingstr[pendingpos - 1]</code>
is <tt>CHAR_ST</tt> no matter whether <tt>ST</tt> has been received simply as <tt>ST</tt>
or its 7-bit equivalent pair.
<p>
If your DCS-Processing function is not DCS-compliant (that is, it does <strong>not</strong> set
<var>curdcs</var> to utself), it will <strong>not</strong> be called when the DCS string processing
will have to terminate (by <tt>STTERM</tt> or <tt>NONSTTERM</tt>).  Instead, it will be aborted
just as any ESC or CSI-processing functions would be.  This, of course, might be the desired behavior.
<p>
In any case, do not forget to add an entry
about your function to VTDCS.T and build VTDCS.TBL.
<HR>
<h2>
<P align=center>Processing Unusual And Nonstandard Commands:</h2>
<UL>
<LI>
If you have to add the processing for a command for which the
standard functionality of the parser is inadequate, you will need
to modify one or more functions from VTPARSER.C. If the what required
is some &quot;afterprocessing&quot; (different default values
for the arguments, for example), the best function to modify is
<code>PAnsi( PS ps )</code>. You will see a number of commands afterprocessed
by <code>PAnsi</code>. HINT: It is sometimes necessary to know whether a parameter
is set to the default value because it has been received as the
default or because it has been missing. In those cases you may
use a field of PS structure <var>argcount</var>.
<p>
<code>PA_USHORT argcount;</code>
<p>
that contains the actual number of the parameters in the parsed
CSI or DCS sequence.<br>
<strong>Examples:</strong> <tt>DO_VTMODE</tt>, <tt>DO_DECRQMANSI</tt>, or <tt>DO_DECCARA</tt>. 
<p>
<LI>
In other to introduce the commands that radically differ from
the similar commands, you will may have to patch <code>ProcessCSI</code> or
<code>ProcessESC</code> functions.<br>
<strong>Example of the patch of <code>ProcessESC</code>:</strong> <tt>DO__DIRECT</tt>.<br>
<strong>Example of the patch of <code>ProcessCSI</code>:</strong> <tt>DO_PRNCTRL</tt>.

<h2><P align=center>Extra Compatibility Scheme:</h2>
<P>
This parser is written and the .T files are distributed with the
Extra Compatibility scheme in mind. This scheme means that in
any VT terminal modes, the parser will understand and correctly
parse escape sequences particular to the other terminal modes,
unless they conflict with the mode's native sequences. This is
meant for the maximum compatibility with the poorly written programs
the application might have to communicate with. For example, there
are no <tt>CSI</tt> sequences in the native VT52 mode, and <tt>ESC A</tt> is the
only way to express &quot;cursor up.&quot; However, the parser
will correctly interpret <tt>CSI A</tt> as &quot;cursor up&quot; (ANSI's
way of moving cursor up) even in VT52 mode. Conversely, <tt>ESC Y</tt>
is defined only in VT52 and means as direct cursor positioning
command. However, if <tt>ESC Y</tt> is encountered in VT420 mode, it still
will be interpreted as direct cursor positioning, even though
formal VT420 specification does not define <tt>ESC Y</tt> to do anything.

<h2><P align=center>Nonstandard Commands Supported by the Parser:</h2>
<P>
A few commands understood by this parser are <strong>not</strong> standard VT commands.
However, a few terminal programs do use them. Theses are the commands
that allow the remote host to control the file system of the terminal.
These commands are <tt>XTRANS</tt>, <tt>XRECEIVE</tt>, <tt>XAPPEND</tt>, and <tt>XSAVE</tt>. In addition
to these, there are some commands (one command and two terminal
responses) unique to this parser. They are <tt>XSUPP</tt> (command) and <tt>XOK</tt> with
<tt>XERROR</tt> (responses). Please, refer to VTCMND.H for a detailed
description of each command.
<HR>
<h2><P align=center>Compiling in the Debugging Mode:</h2>
<P>
When the parser is compiled in the debugging mode, it provides
some additional tests of the integrity of the code and the tables.
If an error is found, <tt>DO_VERR</tt> command is passed to <code>ProcessAnsi</code>
and <var>iArgs[0]</var> is set to the error code. A list of error codes is
found in VTCMND.H. The debugging code is compiled if <tt>_DEBUG</tt> or
<tt>_PA_DEBUG</tt> symbols are defined.
<HR>
<h2><P align=center>Using the Debug Shell (SHELL.C):</h2>
<P>
SHELL.C is a debugging tool that can be used to test the parser's
functionality on a known VT420 data stream or to test the VT420
data stream itself. 
<P>
SHELL.C accepts its input from the standard input and outputs
it to the standard output. Therefore, it can be used with the
operating system's pipe and redirection of input/output mechanisms.
The terminating character for SHELL.C is a character with the
ASCII value of 255. Function ProcessAnsi prints out a character
if a character is received or announces that a function is received
and shows its value, mnemonic, and the contents of <var>iArgs</var> array.
<HR>
<h2><P align=center>Compiling the Parser Applications:</h2>
<P>
The very first time before you compile VTESCSEQ.C, and every time
you change any of the .T files, you will need to run MAKETBL.BAT
to create .TBL files out of the .T files. 
<P>
Also, the very first time before you compile SHALL.C, and every
time you change VTCMND.H file, you will need to run MAKENAME.BAT
to create VTDEBUG.TBL from VTCMND.H.
