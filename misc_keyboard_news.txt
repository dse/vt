As far as I know you can still buy the 5c from Sun, at least they are listed
on Sun's web page with part numbers and prices. I would agree that that the
type 6 feels flimsy compared to a 5, but after using one I really began to
like it. I actually made less typing mistakes on the 6, which is odd because
when ever I change keyboards I take a little time to adjust to the new one.

From the Sun Hardware FAQ:

8)  Can I use a type-4 or type-5 keyboard on a Sun-3 that normally takes
    a type-3 keyboard?

        Yes. The cable/adapter is sold by Sun (P/N 530-1478 or
        530-1479), Sun refurbisher Apex, and possibly others; Sun-3s
        manufactured toward the end came new with type-4 keyboards and
        the appropriate adapter.

25) Can I set the stock Sun serial ports to rates higher than 38400 bps?

        Yes, but you have to hack the kernel in order to do it.
        Furthermore, the standard ZS hardware is not capable of
        supporting the normal bit rates (57600 and 115200) unless you
        can supply an external clock and run them in synchronous mode.
        The only higher internally-generated rates are 51200 (pretty
        useless) and 76800, which a few modems can be set to handle.
        Also, the 76800 rate will result in frequent overruns unless it
        is being used for pure output, such as to a printer.

(From Birdsall's Sun hardware Reference:
 http://www.picarefy.com/~ftp/Sun-Hardware-Ref/parts)

    [1995 Sun SPARCstations seem to have little trouble running 38,400 bps
     under Solaris 2.5+ with no special measures.  A fast CPU helps make up
     for the crude ZS hardware.]

Subject: SUMMARY: Sun US Unix Style Keyboard for a HP WS


I was looking for a keyboard like the ``Sun Type 5 US Unix Style
Keyboard'' to be used with HP Workstations and X-Terminals.

Newer HP Workstations like B132L use PC Style Keyboards, with a PS2
Connector. I don't agree with their Layout.

A PS2 keyboard with Sun US Unix Style layout is available from NCD as
``KS5USUNIX'' (Model: N-123UX). I bought mine from Tekelec Airtronic
GmbH, Germany.

Full Order Description (in Germany) is:
        KS5USUNIX
        Sun 5 kompatible Tastatur fuer NCD
        X-Window Terminals in US Ausfuehrung Unix
        Layout

The Sales Representive from Tekelec was most helpfull.

The NCD Keyboard has all the keys from a Sun US Unix Style Keyboard at
their original positions, plus 5 additional keys between the cursor
keys, and <Del>, <End>, <PageDown>.

                        Tschuess,
                                Andreas

p.s. you will have to create a new keymap/modmap for this keyboard.
     I can mail the keymap/modmap on request.

The xmodmap program is what you want.  Find the keycode of the key you
want to map to Compose (a useful tool for this is /usr/openwin/demo/xev,
if you have it installed, run it and type keys into the window).  On my
keyboard, the right Control key is keycode 71.

Create a file called .Xmodmap in your home directory containing this line:

    keycode 71 = SunCompose

Now type at a shell prompt:

    % xmodmap .Xmodmap

The right control key is now Compose, and works just like a Sun.  If you
want to use the Right Alt key instead, substitute keycode 69 (to find
other keycodes, use /usr/openwin/demo/xev).  To make this permanent, put the
xmodmap command somewhere where it will be executed after OpenWindows starts
(depending on your configuration, this could be .xinitrc or
.openwin-init). Enjoy!

By the way, I had a very difficult time with this same problem in
FreeBSD (XFree86).  I could never get Netscape (an X11R5 binary) to
recognize the accented characters.  I guess that's one advantage of
Solaris...

 Solaris X86 also provides the "pcmapkeys" utility (in SUNWcsu) to
 change the keyboard behavior of the raw console.

 [ Update: as of Solaris 8 X86, Sun changed the default key mappings
   on the PC-type keyboard to more closely resemble those of a SPARC
   machine's keyboard.  The pcmapkeys(1M) utility was removed. ]

The one good thing about less variety (or more accurately, a
*single* keyboard layout available for various systems) is that
what many people seem to hate worst about switching systems is
learning a different keyboard.  If there were a small number of
keyboard layouts (probably max 3 to 5), that were uniform (and uniformly
reprogrammable) across manufacturers, that might not be exactly to
anyone's liking as much, but at least they'd only have to learn one
keyboard layout rather than whining and moaning about learning new ones.

With suitable software (CDE, for example), the keyboards are the main
thing that from the user's perspective keep a heterogenous mix of
systems from being reasonably decent to work with.  (From an
administrator's point of view, too heterogenous a mix of systems is,
and will probably remain for some time, a heck of a lot more work, but
nobody ever listens to SA's anyway.)

Yes, that is a problem we've found with the ASUS P2B-2D's as
well. We're running the latest BIOS available. It doesn't seem to
happen with any other motherboard, so it must be a motherboard/Solaris
issue (it doesn't happen with other OS's on this board either).

My solution was to find the cheapest keyboard I could, take it apart,
and I luckily found that the cord going into a little 1.5"x3" circuit
board with a rubber gasket electrical connection to the mylar sheets
that comprised the keyswitch matrix. I threw away everything but the
circuit board, and wrapped it in electrical tape and taped it on the
back of the case. Instant keyboard cheater (and it certainly didn't
cost ~$96.00 like commercial black boxes that I've found).

Another problem that we've found with this board is that when shutting
down in Solaris, it doesn't do the warm-reboot sometimes. We've had
this problem with some other OS's as well, so its not exactly a
Solaris problem.

I think they have some bugs to get out of this motherboard.

Subject: USB Hub, Keyboard and barcode scanner

System: HP B1000 Visualize workstation running HP-UX 10.20 w. JULY 1999 ACE

USB hub: D6804A HP 4-way hub

Keyboard/Mouse : a4983b standard HP visualize Keyboard and mouse.

Barcode scanner: A piece of kit supplied by a company called symbol. As I
understand it this device appears like a keyboard on the USB bus. It reads
characters off a barcode and squirts them down the USB bus.

I need to run three USB peripherals on a machine with only two USB slots. I
decided to invest in a HP USB hub to expand the machines capacity.

Test configuration:

B1000:

USB Port 1 - MOUSE
USB Port 2 - USB Hub

USB Hub:

Port 1 - Hand Scanner
Port 2 - Keyboard
3- empty
4- empty

The machine boots up O.K. but then will only accept input from the barcode
scanner not the keyboard.

It seems that the system cannot operate with more than one character input
device on the USB Ports. Does anyone know why this is or if there is a
workaround?

Peter Hunt

You'll probably need to do some tweaking in X0devices to get the device

This pretty well ensures that the barcode scanner will be
enumerated before the keyboard, and since it emulates a
keyboard, the system will think it is console.

> character input device on the USB Ports.

Not so.  We routinely stress-test with multiple keyboards.

The problem is that unlike on HP-HIL, "console" does not
automatically get connected to all enumerated USB keyboards.
And unlike PS/2 (with eavesdrop PS/2 barcode readers spliced in
upstream of a PS/2 keyboard), no USB device can eavesdrop on
another, nor insert its data as if it were that device.

Certainly you can open the barcode device to any desired
process.  But if what you want is for scan data to be treated
like typed data and vice-versa (and typically you do want that,
so that the keyboard can be used as backup when the bars don't
scan), then I'll need to make some inquiries.  An answer might
take some time, as two key people are going to be out of
position for some time here.  I suspect it is possible to
do this, perhaps with a simple background pipe.

A workaround that would work is to use a USB-PS/2 adaptor
such as the Y-Mouse, see URL
   http://patriot.fc.hp.com/rjn/usb/usbfaq.htm#Legacy
   (internal HP Web site)
and then use a standard PS/2 keyboard and eavesdrop
PS/2 barcode scanner.

Hint: Once you've got the hang of it, it's easier to do if you don't 
look in a mirror until step 6 is well underway.

Hint 2: You already have the hang of it, because it's basically the 
same as doing up your shoelaces.

Actually, there's a bunch of strange MIDI controllers out there in the art &
technology world.  [See http://www.synthzone.com/ctrlr.htm.]

This one, the BodySynth, is made by a friend of mine, Ed Severinghaus, and does
exactly what you're asking. (That is, it measures the nerve impulses in your
finger, or whatever body parts the controller is connected to, as you tap.)

I don't know shorthand, but it sounds like mapping a single hen
scratch to represent a word of many letters is more efficient.
I'm not sure that ASCII or similar flavors would stay around.

Look at the language those kids, who yak with each other via
a screen, use.  ASCII's useful for storing info that one intends
to read again over the long term.

You bet.  Ornery as ever.  Remember those digitizing pads whose
pucks started sprouting buttons like chicken pox?

Oh, so you prefer optical mice?  <g,d&r>

That's why I'm emphasizing it as an option.  Different strokes...

Which is what many of us here in this newsgroup would be interested in.

Most of us have outgrown 733t sp33k, but there are practical uses for
compact chording keyboards that can be used by one hand.

I believe the "hen scratch per word" encoding system was invented around
2700 BC.  Today we call it "Chinese".

And I believe there is a numeric equivalent for most chinese ideograms.
We could simply replace all icons on GUIs with the equivalent word in
Mandarin, thereby preserving literacy in the world (at least for a
significant percentage) as well as keeping on the current trend of
encouraging users to not bother to spell but memorize little pictures. 
And think of the benefits in compression when all words can be encoded
in 16 bits (IIRC Simplified Chinese fills up most of the encoding for
16-bit Unicode).

Me, I'm dumping all my stock in "Hooked On Phonics".
