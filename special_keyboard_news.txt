 There is a good article in the Electronic Engineering Times (9/16/91) on
the new class of ergonomicly based keyboards starting to emerge from the
drawing boards to the market.

Two pictured in the article are by Health Care Keyboard
Co. Inc. (Menomonee Falls, Wis.) and Kinesis Corp. (Seattle, WA).
They are really a break in the design from what is being used
today. The article mentioned that the IRS is evaluating the Health
care keyboard for its employees.

Here's the promised summary of responses to my keyboards question of last
week.  

Brief summary: the main alternative keyboard layout is the Dvorak one, for
which you can get both replacement keyboards and programs to remap your
keyboard on appropriate machines. Chord keyboards include the BAT and the
Microwriter; there's a company called "Malton or Malvern or something like
that" who do chord keyboards and possibly Dvoraks; and two companies called
Health Care Keyboard Co. Inc. (Menomonee Falls, Wis.) and Kinesis Corp.
(Seattle, WA), who do 'ergonomically-designed' keyboards - presumably still
using QWERTY layouts.  Paul Raveling also enclosed extensive info on his own
keyboard layout, and the rationale behind it, which contains a lot of
interesting thought on keyboard design. Due to the length I haven't included
it all, but it's worth reading. Dick Penn warns of the dangers of
non-standard keyboards, pointing out that there are other ways to reduce
hand strain. 

The second part of my question - have any comparative studies been done -
wasn't so well answered; beyond the news (previously unknown to me) that
Dvorak seems to be only about 10% more efficient than QWERTY, only one
reference came up:

	"Typing with a Two-hand Chord Keyboard: Will the QWERTY become
	 Obsolete?" 
	Daniel Gopher & David Raij
	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Vol 18 No 4
	July/August 1988.

Apparently the BAT keyboard was derived from this work.

Buried further in this message are the address of Infogrip Inc (who do the
BAT) and aphone number for Kinesis; if anyone can get me more info on the
MicroWriter and Malton (or whoever) I'd like to know.

And now a more detailed selection from some responses:

Andrew Dent <dent@dialix.oz.au> provided the following info:

	Rick, there's a product called the BAT keyboard out there which is
	available (at least) for Mac and IBM PC. It is a 7 key chord keyboard
	and you get two units, although either can replace a full 101-key
	keyboard. 

	Company is:

	Infogrip Inc
	812 North Blvd
	Baton Rouge  LA  70802
	(504) 336 0033
	fax:  (504) 336 0063

	Retail $495 (US) and 30-day return.

	They also have a product called a miniBat which is a handheld
	incorporating a chord keyboard.

While Dick Penn <dpenn@bnr.ca> warns

	Beware non-standard keyboards!

	Out in the real world, non-standard keyboards cause all sorts of
	problems, the major one being that the skill you develop through
	typing is not applicable anywhere else. There is more to be gained by
	splitting the standard keyboard vertically, between 5tgb and 6yhn,
	then rotating the two halves so that the center is raised. This is
	supposed to reduce stress on the wrists, and doesn't turn your users
	into expert typists who can only use your system. 

From Pamela Pincha-Wagener <wagener@bcstec.boeing.com>, we find

	There is a good article in the Electronic Engineering Times (9/16/91)
	on the new class of ergonomicly based keyboards starting to emerge

Finally, Paul Raveling <raveling@kestrel.unify.com> sent quite a lot of
stuff, which he posted earlier this year (June). Owing to the length I've cut
it down to just an illustration of his keyboard map, as it appears on an HP
9000/300 series workstation's keyboard:

Regarding the problem of alternative keyboards stuffing up "normal" keyboard
reflexes, one of the points made in the IEEE chord keyboard study was that
the chord was sufficiently different so as to NOT affect normal typing 
skills.
 
Any keyboard, such as Dvorak, which is based on different layout but same
principles as QWERTY, is almost certain to cause "finger confusion".
 
The problem of non-portable typing skills is of course true for any scheme.

I'm disappointed with the small response - maybe there's another group that
would be able to respond with user stories?  I'd really like to hear from
users before investing in one of these things.

This is true.  I have a Microwriter portable computer with a chord keyboard,
and I don't get confused moving between it and a standard QWERTY keyboard.

Alternatively, I have a file of information about it, and I can comment

Also, Infogrip, Inc., in Baton Rouge, LA, USA, makes a two-handed
chord keyboard for the Mac and for the IBM-PC.  The Mac one plugs into
the Apple Desktop Bus, and the PC one hooks into the serial port
(although later versions will plug into the keyboard port).  Their
address and phone number are:

Infogrip, Inc.
812 North Boulevard
Baton Rouge, LA 70802
USA

Tel: (504) 336-0033
Fax: (504) 336-0063

They also sell the Microwriter Agenda under a different name here in
the states.  Either hand on the two-handed keyboards can completely
replace the whole keyboard.  They come with a pattern that is different
than the Agenda, but it can be re-programmed in any configuration you
want.

Maybe all a chord keyboard can let you do is enter commands or type with one
hand while selecting on screen entities with another.  Given the right
kind of interface, this can be a great boon to productivity, even if
your typing speed is slowed by chording.  So I don't see the true
relevance of the input speed when one considers it part of a two-handed
interface.  This is what Doug Engelbart settled on after a good deal of
experimentation at SRI with odd interaction devices and techniques.
(The mouse being the device used by the other hand.)

Engelbart will tell you that they were never able to measure the
difficulty of learning to chord because people picked it up so fast.  He
uses the example of his pre-school age daughters who learned all the
letter-chord combinations in a short time.

I was also able to learn the AgendA's letter chords in under a half
hour.  With a different 7-key chord system (4 fingers and 3 keys that
the thumb alternates among), I was able in one evening to produce a
useful set of chord to character bindings that I could remember which
gave me convenient access to the whole command set of my chosen editor
(emacs) via the use of only one hand (though two can be used).  In fact,
the access is in some ways more convenient than the standard keyboard
because I was able to provide a lock mode for both control key and
meta/alt key inputs, similar to the command mode of other editors.
(No queries on this stuff, though, please.  I just wanted to provide the
example to show that their are indeed uses for the technology, many of
which I haven't mentioned here.)

here is another piece of info I got in reply to my recent posting:

From: Randy <72246.172@CompuServe.COM>

     A friend called me on the phone and read me your message
about the Dvorak keyboard.  I don't (yet!) have direct internet
access, so I'm sending you this via my Compuserve mailbox.

     There are indeed many people using the Dvorak.  *Briefly*,
the Dvorak was designed via ergonomic proceedures to be easy to
learn and use for "touch" (10-finger) typing.  "Qwerty" was
designed in the 1870s to overcome the mechanical limitations of
early typewriters (specifically, the first Remington model).
Touch typing was thought of long after these "modern" typewriters
came on the market.  Dvorak typists tend to be much faster, both
because of ease of typing (70% of keying is on the home row, vs
32% on Qwerty) and because of the reduced error rate on Dvorak
due to its ergonomics, but the ease in learning and typing is its
greatest advantage.

     A number of products are available to help learn the Dvorak
layout.  Both "Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing" and "Typing Tutor"
come with Dvorak lessons, for instance.

     The primary source of Dvorak information is Freelance
Communications.  Among other products, they carry my book, The
Dvorak Keyboard, which will help to get you started (the only
book on the subject; 96 pp trade softcover; $12.95+ship).  A

Way back in my typing carrer I remapped my keyboard and used the 'Typing
Tutor' program that IBM used to sell for almost nothing.  This was when
I bought my first computer in '82 or so.

I was able to get speed equal to a normal keyboard in fairly short order,
but that is not saying much, as I didn't not type well on either keyboard
at the time.  This even tho the early excercises concentrated on words 
easy on the normal keyboard.  That is the letters a, s, d, f, j, k, l.

I gave it up when I realized that:

	*	I probably could not as fast on two keyboards as I could on either
		one, even if the one was poorly designed.

	*	I probably could not ensure availability of dvorak.  What if I
		had to sit at a coworkers station for a few minutes to demonstrate
		something?  What if I had to used a mechanical typewriter or other
		non remappable keyboard?

So go for it, but realize that it may not save you any time or frustration
in the end.  It is to bad, sometimes, that these standards can get so
much momentum.

Where did you get this program?  I tried to learn the keyboard a while
back but had to stop because I couldn't use it on Unix.  My technique
for learning was simple.  Just type all my papers, letters, etc.  Type
a few pages a day.  The only problem is that once you start, you will
probably not type as fast in QWERTY for a while.  It took me about
a year to undo four months of Dvorak.

Good luck!

Dear David,

   I recently converted a keyboard to a Dvorak layout but have not as
yet got around to using Mavis for the practice to achive touch typing
confidence.

   Simply popping the keys out and swapping them around works only on
a few boards (HoneyWells?) as most have different profiles for
different rows - the home row etc.  Presumably yours didn't or you are
using the alternative of stickers?  The former has one draw back - {}
[] are located on different keys on a qwerty board whereas the dvorak
accesses them by a shift on the same key.  I think the dvorak wins for
speed (on that combination anyway).

   Dispite many attempts in the past, especially in the '60s, by some
very powerful players it is most unlike qwerty boards will ever be
replaced.  Therefore you must realize that using your board will be
for ease at home.  The only other alternative is to become so
proficient that you are able to use a board without looking (at all!)
and import your driver (or carry a disk with it on around).

   Problems I have noticed: the layout in WinMavis didn't seem to
change on screen in the version I saw but did on the original?  If you
are using a PC the driver that comes in the Dos 6 Supplementary disk
is ignored by Windows.  Microsoft have done it again...
  
   Could you please tell me which driver you are using and where you
obtained it from?  Do you know of any others?

Regards,
James Stoney.

Despite all the research on the ease of learning DVORAK and the
efficient use of the system, it is my opinion that because the
majority of the population would have to re-learn a new system
and because of the future impact of voice technology, most
persons do not want to bother with a new system at this time.
Also, even though many keyboards can be switched to either
DVORAK or QWERTY by the computer system or by software, there
is no guarantee that DVORAK will be available in every
available worksite.  For these reasons, I have not agressively
sought a change to DVORAK in keyboarding instruction in VA
public schools (we are having a hard enough time convincing
earlier grade levels that a touch system of keyboarding is
necessary for effective interaction with a keyboard, especially
in writing).

Recently, one of our business teachers in Frederick Co., Linda
Wilson of James Wood High School, 161 Apple Pie Ridge Rd.,
Winchester, VA 22603 (Phone 703/667-5226), asked for
information for instructional materials for DVORAK.  I
referred her to our Virginia Vocational Curriculum and Resource
Center to conduct a computer search for information.  I have
not heard of Linda's results, but you may want to contact her.
I do not know whether she has a va.pen/internet account.

The only other suggestion I have is to contact major keboarding
publishers such as Southwestern Publishing Co. and Glencoe,
Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, and others. 

I would be interested in your findings.

	Hi, I was wondering what kind of program is it? Where can I get a copy
of it? Also does the program come with a doc that tells you the layout of the
keyboard? I've heard about this type of keyboard, and it's adventages. You see
on a regular keyboard, the most common keys are located on the left hand. In
this new keyboard layout, the most common keys will be on the right hand. ALso
the distrubtion of keys will be equal on both hands when you are typing.

I have been using a Dvorak keyboard for about 2 years now.  I used to
touch-type on a QWERTY, and the first few days after I switched were
far more disoriented than I had imagined they would be.  The next few
weeks were incredibly frustrating.  I would say it was 8-10 months
before I could equal the speed I used to get with a QWERTY keyboard,
but its hard to say for sure because I never really measured either
one.

Now that I have gotten really familiar with the Dvorak keyboard, I
really like it.  It even serves as an interesting security device for
times when one of my officemates tries to type something when I'm
logged in :-)  I did not have a book to learn from - I just started
typing and learned by practice, assuming the basic "home positions"
and ideas about which fingers should hit which keys are independent of
the mapping from keys to letters.

Unfortunately, as I type as much C code as text, I don't get nearly as
much of a speedup as one might hope for, as the numbers and symbols
are hard to get at on either keyboard.

I just made a small printout of the layout and taped it to the
bottom edge of my monitor.  It worked fine an finally cured me of
looking at the keyboard since looking there din't help!

>Does anybody actually use a dvorak - I'd appreciate any comments you

I've been using it for about 10 years and have no desire to give
it up.  :)   I'm not particulary quick with my fingers so even
with dvorak, my typing speed is short of amazing.  The critical
factor is that I find it *much* quicker and *much* less tiring to
type dvorak.  

Spend a couple weeks learning and you will never want to go back.
Thanks to computers, the occasions that you do are rare.  Even on
a dumb terminal you can have dvorak if you use GNU emacs!

Many people feel that if they learn dvorak, they will forget
qwerty.  I have not found that to be true and switching back and
forth does not cause too much greif.  I often have to jump
between a computer and typewriter and have not had problems.
I've talked with others who have the same experience.

Happy typing!

Dave,

   I also have been very interested in this prospect. I'm able to type
between 60-70 words a minute now, but I understand that I could conceivably
TRIPLE that by using a Dv keyboard. 

   Would you be interested in starting a communication with me to form kind
of a "support" group for learning it? We could encourage each other and
exchange information about Dving. Anyways. Would you know of a good keyboard
that would be available for the IBM (Dv, of course). 

   Good luck one way or the other though!

Hi!

I use the dvorak keyboard, although I have not gained as much speed
with it as the american standard. I think that the dvorak keyboard is
worth learning. However, you must have patience.

Below are two xmodmap files which convert dvorak to qwerty and back
again. The xdvorak program never worked for me, so I use these
instead.

Good luck!

From: Doug.Landauer@Eng.Sun.COM (Doug Landauer)

I've been using a Dvorak-like layout for about 11 years now.
The speed increase is real but negligible (5% to 10%).  The
more important advantage (IMHO) is the lower likelihood of
wrist nerve damage and carpal tunnel syndrome.  Here in SunPro,
several people in my building alone have gotten CTS or its
precursors or related problems since SPARCstations, with their
awful keyboard layout, became prevalent.  I think that my use
of the Dvorak-like layout has been part of the reason that I
have so far escaped this problem, and it is despite the fact that
I've been putting in lots of long hours for about the past year.

I didn't use anything to teach me it -- I just tried things, and
typed sorta slowly for about a month.

Yes, Typing Tutor IV is programmed to use the Dvorak keyboard - that is,
teach the home row first, then the farther letters.  It's how I learned.

My only comment is that you're in trouble when you have to do a lot of
typing on other machines.  I learned Dvorak keyboard 5 years ago, before
I knew I'd have to type a lot at work.  My own desk computer is a PC, so
I can handle that, but the main computers shared with others is a
mainframe, with no Dvorak capability.  Likewise with the occasions I have
to use a typewriter.

Still, I now type 55 wpm, whereas with the QWERTY layout, the max I ever
did was 13!

From: gasior@ltpsun.gsfc.nasa.gov (Eric Gasior)

I been using a Dvorak keyboard on my Mac for a couple of months. The
biggest problem I have is that my typing speed hasn't recovered, but that's
partly because the key caps are still for a standard keyboard.

It is more comfortable than a qwerty keyboard - my fingers and wrists move
less. Adapting to the new punctuation positions is wierd. The only serious
complaint that I have with the design is that the "f" key should be easier
to reach.

Dear Sirs,

We would like to interest you in securing the rights of a novel kind of 
keyboard for computer data entry which was recently granted a U. S. Patent.
The innovative advantages over conventional computer keyboards include:

1. Its size is only about 25% of the regular keyboard.

2. It requires minimal training and facilitates easy head-up typing which 
   is natural even to beginners.

3. It can also serve as a pointing device, thus eliminating the need of an 
   additional mouse or trackball.

4. It is ideally suited for Laptop and other small computers where space is 
   constrained.

5. It has very few moving parts and therefore is more reliable and robust 
   compared to conventional keyboards.

6. The operating principle ergonomically matches the human hands and the 
   typing operation causes minimal strain on the wrists and fingers.

7. It can accommodate considerably more alpha-numeric characters and symbols 
   than regular keyboards.

8. It requires simpler electronics and circuitry than conventional keyboards.

9. It can be easily installed in conjunction with regular keyboards as a 
   peripheral device.

If your firm is interested in more details describing this invention, please 
contact us for initiating more discussions.

Sincerely yours,

Jezekiel Ben-Arie (D.Sc.)

I'm pleased to announce Lexmark Int'l, a former division of IBM; and
BackCare Corporation, a Chicago based computer ergonomic company; have
signed a national distribution agreement for distribution of Lexmark's
Select-Ease keyboard.

The new keyboard features an innovative design for flexibility and
adjustability, allowing the user to shape the keyboard into a number of
different positions.  The keyboard features a separate 10-key number pad,
which can be placed on the right or left side of the keyboard.  The retail
price of the keyboard with the number pad is $199.00 and $179.00 without
the number pad.

Neal Taslitz, President and CEO of the BackCare Corporation, said: "the
Lexmark Select-Ease offers multiple adjustments and user friendly
features, which many computer users need to type comfortably and
efficiently--at an affordable price." Taslitz believes the Select-Ease
design is one of the best he has seen to date, at a price that is far less
than others with less flexibility.

Taslitz has followed computer ergonomics closely for the past six years
and says that corporate America has now begun to understand the benefits
that they can gain, by allowing their employees to adjust their
workstations to their own needs.  He believes the keyboard to be an
important part of the ergonomic equation.

We invite you to evaluate the Select-Ease keyboard* for thirty days with
an unconditional return. If interested, please advise Chris Stelmack via
e-mail (address is: christel@interaccess.com).  Under subject, please type
"Keyboard".  Further ordering instructions will be sent to you.  

*Note:  Select-Ease is compatible with the IBM PS/1, PS/2, 286AT - and all
IBM compatibles.

Use an 8751, 10 switches (thumbs), and a max232 for rs232 level generation.
The whole circuit can be build with the two chips, a crystal, and a handful
of caps and resistors.

I've always thought ski pole grips would be a good place to start for the
actual "keyboards".

Have a look at the December 1993 Circuit Cellar Ink ("The Computer

item about building a 5 key Chordic Keyboard system with a 2 line x 40
character display and an RS-232 port. The idea being that by itself the
unit can do some data entry/editing (the unit being driven off a small
commercial 80C32 based controler board), and then under command it can
transmit data via the RS-232 port. Even if this isn't quite the ticket for
you, it should give you some good ideas to get started with.

You need just the connector cable, but MS probably won't sell it to you
unless policy has changed.  A while back someone posted to USENET a
report that his MS Mouse cable was damaged (supposedly the cat chewed
through it...) and MS explicitly refused to sell a replacement.  It
wouldn't hurt to try calling MS, however, and ask for a supervisor
if whoever you're talking to doesn't understand your question.

If you can rebuild the mini-DIN connector, here are the pinouts:

Looking into the connector at the CPU end of the cable, you see six pins, 
plus the key.  Counting *clockwise* from the key, the pins are:

 6 - reserved
 4 - +5 VDC
 2 - reserved
 1 - +data
 3 - ground
 5 - keyboard clock

(remember: you're looking into the connector on the cable, with the
cable to the keyboard going away from you.)

Looking down on the connector to the PCB inside the keyboard, you
see (left-to-right) with the results of my quick ringout of the cable:

 Red    - pin 5
 Brown  - pin 3
 clear  - n/c
 Yellow - pin 4
 Black  - pin 1

so the color sequence at the mini-DIN connector, clockwise from the
key, is n/c, yellow, n/c, black, brown, red.

None of the five PCB connections has continuity to the shell of the
mini-DIN.  I don't know where the clear wire on the center pin of
the PCB connector goes; I expect that the mini-DIN shell is tied to
the cable shield.

Note: I checked this, wrote up my notes, and reassembled the keyboard.
After I did this I realized that I hadn't written down the color sequence
on the PCB connector so that's from memory, but the color-to-pin data
is from my written notes.  (Of course, the color mappings might change
between OEM suppliers to Microsoft...)

I've just bought the Twiddler -- USD199 plus USD28.80 for shipping
here to Singapore.  It took about 4 weeks (after I'd sent off an
International Bank Draft) for the unit to reach .sg via US Postal
Service.

Quality is so-so, it feels a tad flimsy, and the paint on the keys
looks like it's going to rub off with heavy usage.  There are
drivers for Linux (user level, no kernel patches req'd), for DOS
and Windows 3.1, and _finally_ for Win95 and WinNT.  The Linux
driver is a bit of a hassle to setup, I'll prolly go in and hack
the code a bit to make it easier to use and more robust.  The Win95
driver works fine.

It's kinda strange to hold at first, but you get used to it.  My
girlfriend, who has small hands, has trouble using it -- it's just
too big for her.

Typing speed right now is s-l-o-o-o-o-w.  Hark back to the days you
first used a QWERTY keyboard, and had to hunt and peck for each
and every key.  Now imagine you only have 12 keys and have to remember
arcane key combinations in order to get all the letters and symbols.
Now imagine that the keyboard is facing away from you and you can't even
see the keys.  :-)

But with practice, I'm sure I'll get up to 40 or so wpm.  That would
be slower than my current 65-70wpm touch typing, but seeing as how
an hour touch typing just kills my wrists, a little time spent
on the Twiddler would pay off heaps.

I wanted to buy one--but seeing as how it's not available yet,
the Twiddler was the only choice.

Hope this info helps someone out there.  As usual, YMMV.

Cheers.

Just to let people know of an alternative place to get a Twiddler.  When I
decided I wanted one to play with, I looked into buying it from HandyKey.
They wanted me to send them a check, wait for it to clear, etc., etc.

A quick AltaVista search found http://www.safecomputing.com/ that had
the device in stock, sold it for less ($179), accepted my Visa card, and
shipped it the same day, using my own fedex account.  I placed the order
moments before 5pm EST, and had the Twiddler on my desk the following morning.

The difference is that you don't have to stretch your fingers to
reach the keys that are off the "home row", because a chord
keyboard only has one "row". If you include the distance you move
away from the home row, a chord keyboard has less finger
movement. If it's designed properly (with good quality
keyswitches), your fingers barely have to move at all.

Wrist position is also important, and this depends on the overall
design of the keyboard. But you have fewer design constraints
with a chord keyboard because you have fewer keys, so you have a
better chance of coming up with a design that works.

No disagreement there. Also, I've heard that job-related stress
can make it worse, and no magic keyboard is going to solve that.
(This should not be too surprising, since stress makes a lot of
things worse.)

In any case, as far as I know the original purpose of the chord
keyboard was to allow you to keep your other hand on the mouse;
nobody was worried about RSI's back then. I've heard that they
were always used together at SRI, but for some reason Xerox and
Apple thought they could do it all with the mouse (much to the
chagrin of touch-typists-- note that chording is just a different
kind of touch-typing). I think the folks at SRI would have used
the regular keyboard for large volumes of text entry, but I could
be wrong.

IBM had a different idea where they used chords for common letter
sequences, so that you could type *faster*, but again they
weren't concerned about RSI's (there's an article about their
experimental keyboard in IEEE Computer, Dec 1978).

The Microwriter Agenda used a chord keyboard because it would fit
in your pocket-- an excellent idea, but for some reason people
assumed it would be hard to learn (the research says otherwise).
The keyboards on most pocket-sized computers certainly aren't any
easier to use than a chord keyboard.

What's an "air keyboard"?

    [Archiver's Note: "using an air keyboard" means
     pretending to type, in the air.

     Your archiver typed these words on a Microsoft Natural Keyboard,
     which is actually made by Key Tronic, with a bit of software
     in place to make the CapsLock key act as a Control key.  With
     some applications, I have a Dvorak layout configured, also.
