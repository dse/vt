Telnet News

(plus guidance on how X and telnet are not the same thing...)

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The "telnet" protocol provides a connection to a remote computer that acts
as though the terminal were connected locally.

Depending on the type of computer on which it is running, a "telnet" client
program may or may not perform terminal emulation.  Typically a telnet client
connects via a TCP connection to a "telnetd" program or process running on
the remote computer.

Historically, the Telnet protocol is older than TCP/IP, having been first
used on the old ARPAnet, back when IMPs were in style.

Some details of the Telnet protocol may be seen, courtesy of RADCOM.CO.IL, at

In practice, as of A.D. 2002, most implementations of the telnet protocol
do not contain an encryption mechanism for passwords.  Some simple needs
for security can be satisfied by a "Secure Shell" (SSH) connection.

    http://www.ssh.fi/
    http://www.massconfusion.com/ssh/ssh_resources.html

An open-source implementation, OpenSSH, can be found at

    http://www.openssh.org/

The SSH FAQ resides at

    http://ns.uoregon.edu/pgpssh/sshfaq/index.html

On a PC, see

    http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html

But beware the short-password problem in old commercial releases:

    http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/20594.html

Large-scale connection setups probably need something more heavy-duty,
such as Kerberos, for which central administration is easier and safer:

Recent IETF Requests for Comments define pluggable security mechanisms that
may come into use in the future:

    RFC 2941 "Telnet Authentication Option"
    http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc2941.html

    RFC 2946 "Telnet Data Encryption Option"
    http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc2946.html

Other security mechanisms that may be appropriate for telnet sessions include:

 -  IP-based authentication (with limitations properly understood)
 -  firewall filtering
 -  hardware-assisted one-time passwords (e.g., RADIUS, Safeword, SecurID)

You are finding out that the terminal emulation is normally implemented
in the telnet *client* program, not on the host/server side (which is
where terminfo and termcap operate).

You'd benefit from reading background material archived at:
(this website) http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html

The older Televideo (TVI) terminal types were not fully ANSI-compliant;
therefore you cannot use the ANSI-X3.64-type (actually VT100) emulation
that is built into the normal "xterm" program used in Unix and Linux.

(Stratus Computer formerly sold the Televideo 955 terminal under its
own label, as the Stratus V102 terminal.)

If you could have your users continue to run IRIX (or HP-UX, Solaris,
AIX, or SCO Unix--the traditional Unix platforms), you could look at
several commercial terminal-emulation products, some of which can
mimic the TVI955.  Products that I know of are listed at:

    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/pc_emulation.html#unix_emul_vendors

However, for open-source Linux, commercial products supporting the
proprietary Televideo device controls are downright scarce.  It is,
however, possible that one of the vendors listed is now supporting Linux.

However, another technique would be to run a Java environment or Web
browser on your Linux boxes and use one of the terminal-emulation applets
products written in Java.  The ones I'm aware of are listed at this URL
(there may be others):

Microsoft Telnet does not support Telnet "Negotiate About Window Size".

Therefore, the host has no way of automatically getting the window size
from the the telnet client.

That sequence (which is "ESC =", not "ESC [ ="), sets the mode of the
numeric keypad, not the cursor keys. Setting the cursor key mode is
a private DEC sequence, DECCKM.

You send "ESC [ ? 1 l" to get the up key reporting "ESC [ A" (which
is called Cursor Mode. You send "ESC [ ? 1 h" (Application Mode) to
get the Up key to report "ESC O A".

None of the sequences above really have spaces (or quotes!) in.

These are the same sequences as for the VT100, a summary of which can
be found at http://www.celigne.co.uk/terminal/docs/tp83/appendixb/

This is because the Microsoft Telnet client does *not* properly
implement either of the two terminal types it claims to support.
In fact, there is no difference between the emulations it uses,
regardless of which you choose.

To get proper terminal emulation, use a Telnet client that properly
implements the terminal types you need.

Kermit 95 is one program that provides solid emulations of over 30
terminals including HPTERM.  See further details at

Do you mean that you want to run graphical programs like Netscape
or maybe a whole CDE session on the Solaris system and have them
displayed on the NT system?  If so, this can be done, but it is not
done with telnet.  You need to get an X server for your NT machine.
You should be able to get one at http://www.tucows.com/ .

Once you have the X server installed on your Windows NT machine and
running, you need to set the DISPLAY variable to the hostname of
the NT machine followed by a ":0" (probably), and then launch some
graphical programs.  They should display on the Windows NT machine.

If you use sh or ksh, the commands would look like:

	DISPLAY=myntmachine:0
	export DISPLAY
	xclock&
	netscape&

for csh, replaces the first two lines with "setenv DISPLAY myntmachine:0".

You can run these commands from anywhere you can type commands, including
a telnet session, so you don't need to be logged into the machine to do it.

An alternative to installing X software on the NT machine is install VNC
software on both the Solaris and NT machine, and then use that to display
programs remotely.  If you want to do that, the VNC homepage is at
http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/ .

Hope that helps.

I would be skeptical of that answer.  Yes, people who told you that might
believe it's true, but they could also just be ignorant.  (This could be
unintentional, i.e., "I've never heard of this telnet thing so I'll just
say it's a security risk", or intentional, i.e., "I read in KioskWeek that
telnet was a security risk; I've never used it, so I'll just assume the
article is correct".)

If you don't like that angle, I can think of a genuine security risk.  I
assume that all of the Web-page crackings, denial-of-service-attacks, etc.
that we've been hearing about lately require telnet... can you do anything
like that with just a Web browser?  There's also the problem that many telnet
programs don't use encryption.

Personally, I still believe in my first suggestion -- there are some pretty
dismal public Internet sites out there.  A hotel in Canada that I stayed in
said they had 'Net access.  I don't know if they said it was complete access.
It turned out to be a little office with a computer running Outlook or some
other Windows mail program.  They didn't want me to use telnet or any Web
browser.  I doubt they wanted me to set up POP or IMAP either.  Since I came
there to check my mail, the whole thing was completely useless.  As a last
resort I asked about receiving mail, and they gave me an address (with MCI
Mail, IIRC) which seemed completely unconnected with the hotel or the company
running this "business center" or anything else.  Incidentally, this little
office had Xerox's name on it.  Considering that they created Ethernet, they
should have higher standards. :)

Note that are some good Internet kiosks too.  I eventually went down the
street to a little computer store that provided 'Net access on the side.
They were helpful and had no problems setting me up with telnet.  There are
also the kiosks in the Seattle airport, which do have telnet.  (They also
have outrageous rates, and random keys on the keyboards tend to be broken,
but they *do* have telnet.)

That's because the Internet is for looking at blinking text and
pretty pictures.  It's *not* for getting useful work done, which
you might be able to do if telnet worked.

Just use MindTerm, a Java xterm/ssh client.  It is available from
http://www.mindbright.se/mindterm/.  If you use a signed version of the
applet (which they have on their web site), you can connect anywhere
(via ssh of course) from an applet.  I put a copy of it on my personal

I'm almost certain there's at least one telnet implementation in Java. A
quick search will probably prove that. So, if you can use a browser to
use telnet, why not provide one to save the hassle?

As a quick survey of the BUGTRAQ archives and the like will show you,
the tools of choice for trivial denials of service and the like these
days are email for exploiting idiotic active-content MUAs, and the
combination of Perl and netcat for quick & dirty buffer overruns.

Driving exploits by hand with telnet is *so* a few minutes ago.

Yes indeedy.  (The Win9x con\con vulnerability, for example.)

Besides the SSH-Telnet Java applet someone's already mentioned,
there's an SRP-Telnet Java applet that comes with the SRP suite.  
(For my money, SRP is much better than SSH.  Perfect forward security,
for one thing.  A very nice protocol, vetted by some of the best experts
working in public.)

The principle's valid, anyway.  Go to a site with a Java telnet
client.  Run it.  End of telnet prohibition.  Perhaps they've
disabled Java as well.  I can't see any justification for it, though;
the problem isn't telnet (or Java).  Browsers are already a huge
security hole; most of them are active-content MUAs, for example.

At least in older versions of netscape/mozilla (2/?) you could use URL's
of the form

http://host:25/%10mail%20from%20<blah@site>%10rcpt%20to%20<local>%10data%10test%10.%10/

Which, for example would send mail to user "local" on site "host".

The Solaris man-page presents
BANNER="`uname -sr`"
for /etc/default/telnetd.

Tracing proved it indeed uses "sh" to process /etc/default/telnetd

A UMASK= is not described for /etc/default/telnetd,
but may work nevertheless (though my test was negative).

Finally, telnetd execs /bin/login
which processes /etc/default/login without the help of sh.
This is the right location for UMASK=

Subject: 8-bit telnet connection to Unix host using an X client

Using a terminal emulator from a Windows 95 workstation, I can establish
either a 7 or 8 bit telnet connection to a Unix host. I just need to
select the desired mode from the terminal emulator.

Now connecting to the same unix host, through an X client, I can't figure
out where the same kind of setting could be modified.

So my question is the following: is this 8 bit kind of connection supported
by the X environment? (if so how can I force this behaviour?)

Thanks in advance

A telnet connection in an X Window is provided by the telnet client usually 
called 'telnet' (although it might be 'kermit').

The terminal is your X Window (usually Xterm) which may or may not have
a choice of emulations of real terminals.

First, read 'man X' on your Linux box.

The general idea is that two machines running X can display everything on
both screens. Exceed is a X-emulator for Windows. XFree86 is not an
emulator but a real (and FREE, and STABLE,...) X-server. You can tell
your own XFree86 to accept pictures from foo.bar.com by typing 

  xhost +foo.bar.com (when you are running X of course)

and then telnet to foo.bar.com and if this machine is running X you can
tell it to display the applications output to you screen  by typing:

  netscape -display your.ip.address.com:0.0 (for instance)

all X-applications have the '-display or -d' switch.

Do 'man X' to read about the :0.0.


Have fun

Short answer: It depends.

What is the protocol ? LAT or TELNET ?
What is the opsys of the target node ? OpenVMS with DCL ?

If TELNET: check the SYN function of the TELNET connection. It is usually
	mapped to ^X

If LAT and OpenVMS with DCL: check the setting of the terminal for line
	editing. ^X is used by DCL (nearly like the ^U) for "Deletes chars
	from the beginning of the line to the cursor"

What do you want to do ?

Proper terminology is LU (= logical unit) name.

A few servers allow non-TN3270E clients to request a specific LU
by tacking the LU name on to the terminal type request separated
by a "@" (ie. instead of TTYPE IBM-3278-2, send
TTYPE IBM-3278-2@LU_NAME).

The spec (RFC) for this was written by OpenConnect, I don't know
if any other servers implement this. Other servers may have non-standard
ways of doing this -- my company (www.ioconcepts.com) has a
hardware-based server which talks to standard clients using the TN3270
protocol but adds a private telnet option for our own client software
which allows the clients to request a specific LU and much more, too,
such as exchanging SNA status info, etc. If you're using our hardware
you can request our documentation for this private telnet option.

Sure, but be warned: it's a slippery slope.  Telnet is not a simple
protocol, at least not any more.  It started out as RFC854 in 1983 and
has grown ever since.  A current search of the RFC database for "telnet"
turns up 107 references.

Unfortunately, all too many people crank out ad-hoc Telnet clients by

   (a) trial and error
   (b) asking somebody how to do it and then acting on bad advice
   (c) copying some code they found by searching the Internet
or
   (d) following RFC854 but nothing else

All of these, including (d), are likely not to work when fielded against
the variety of Telnet servers, ancient to modern, that exist today. 
Doing it right is a long, hard, big job, and the job doesn't end when
just one test case works.

While I'm at it, I should mention that more than a few Telnet servers
violate the IETF standards.  Unfortunately, many writers of Telnet
implementations don't know this, and so tailor their programs to work with
the faulty servers, thus propagating their errors and making matters more
difficult for everybody.

Again, see:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/telnet.html

to get an idea of some of the considerations that must go into writing
modern and correct Telnet sofware, especially the later sections that deal
with broken Telnet implementations.

                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is no concept of a private TELNET option.  All TELNET options
must be allocated by IANA.  All you do by using unallocated TELNET
option numbers is cause interoperability problems in the future.

It is because of so-called "private" TELNET options that we now have
options allocated at values 138, 139, 140, and 200.

What value are you using?

Subject: SCO UNIX emulation help

To anyone that can help me,

I am currently having quite a bit of difficulty trying to connect to a
SCO OpenServer Release 5 as a VT220 over Telnet.

If I connect to this machine as a VT220 directly using a serial
connection I can connect fine.

However, as soon as I try to connect via Telnet, I get the logon prompt
and then the socket is disconnected.  I believe that, because of this,
the trouble lies not in my interpretation of the VT220 emulation but in
the Telnet connection itself.  They are able to connect to this machine
using other emulators such as QVTerm and windows telnet.

To make my life easy, for all the DO commands I get, I reply with a
DONT and a WONT except when I get a DO Terminal Type in which case I
reply back with a WILL and later send back the string "VT220" in a
subnegotiation.

Other than that, I recieve a WILL Suppress Go Ahead and a WILL Echo to
which I reply back with a DO.  I also recieve a WILL Status that I
reply with a DONT.

I believe that, other than the echo and the suppress go ahead,
everything else is the default answer.  However, as soon as it sends me
the first chunk of text to display, the socket sends me a message
telling me that it has closed itself.

These are the commands I recieve:

DO - (0x25) Authentication Option
DO - (0x18) Terminal Type (I return by sending the string "VT220")
DO - (0x20) Terminal Speed
DO - (0x23) X Display Location
DO - (0x27) New Environment Option
DO - (0x24) Environment Option
WONT - (0x18) Terminal Type
SB - (0x18) Terminal Type - (0x01) SEND - SE
WILL - (0x03) Suppress Go Ahead
DO - (0x01) Echo
DO - (0x1F) Negotiate About Window Size
WILL - (0x05) Status
DO - (0x21) Remote Flow Control
DO - (0x03) Suppress Go Ahead
WILL - (0x01) Echo

Everything except the WONT Terminal Type and the DO Suppress Go Ahead
is sent by the server as default.  The other two are sent as replies to
my requests.

I am able to connect to all other unix boxes and linux boxes I've
tried.  I have no idea what is so unique about this particular SCO Unix
box (I have not tried it on another SCO system.  Currently looking into
getting one).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if this is not the right
forum for this post, please let me know.

If you reply, please send me a copy via e-mail as well since I don't
read this group as often.

Thank you in advance,

I would suggest you go and read the RFCs for Telnet.  You are not

Unfortunately I did....all of the RFC's concerning the commands state
that the default is a DON'T and a WON'T.

The Terminal Type is negotiated correctly since on our Sun station, if
I send the wrong string (for example "DEC-VT220" rather than "VT220"),
when I run vi I get the error "Unknown terminal type".  Also, in the
case of SCO, if I send a string other than "VT220" that it doesn't
recognize, it will ask me again like the RFC states that it should.  As
long as I send "VT220" it seems to be happy.

For the SGA, the RFC states that the client and the server needs to
suppress the GA independently.  Thus, when I get a WILL, I reply with a
DO and a WILL and the server will then confirm me by sending me back a
DO.

So I believe the commands (at least the Terminal Type and SGA) are
being handled correctly.  However, there is obviously an error
somewhere that only SCO seems to be picky about.  It must not like
SOMETHING that I'm replying using the default but the RFC doesn't seem
to shed any light at all (...70+ pages of dry RFC's...ew...).

Has anyone else ever run into a similar problem?  The few times I ran
into a problem where the server didn't like my reply, it at least let
me log in and use it though it might have sent garbage here and again.
I've never seen one that just closes the socket right up...

Again, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

Correct.  The default state for all negotiations is that they are DONT
or WONT depending on the direction of the negotiation.  But not all 
negotiations may be ignored.  SGA for instance MUST NOT be ignored 
and it MUST be negotiated in both directions.  You can't negotiate
one direction and ignore the request in the other direction.

Your previous message said that in response to

you are responding

when you MUST respond 

  WILL TERM-TYPE

and only send 

  SB IS VT220

in response to

Why don't you try again and send a full log of your negotiations
including the SEND and RECEIVE direction of each statement in turn.
I have never had any problem with telnet negotiations to an SCO system.

You can also try connecting your Telnet client to 

  watsun.cc.columbia.edu 1649

The Internet Kermit Service is extremely rigid when it comes to 
negotiating the Telnet negotiations.  If it is not done by the RFCs
you will likely hang the connection.

Sorry...I should have been clearer.  Yes, that is what I do.  When I
get a DO, I send a WILL, then I send my terminal type when they send me
a SB SEND.  Sorry.

I will do that.  I'll have to modify the code to create another log
file for commands going out along with the commands coming in.  I will
post that as soon as I get one.

I will try that too.  Thank you for all the help.

Okay, I got the log for both incoming and outgoing Telent commands.
I'll use "R" for recieved and "S" for sent and list them sequentially.
('' = the same command)

R: DO - Authentication Option (0x25)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: DO - Terminal Type (0x18)
S: WILL - ''
S: DO - ''<- will be ignored by server later

R: DO - Terminal Speed (0x20)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: DO - X Display Location (0x23)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: DO - New Environment Option (0x27)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: DO - Environment Option (0x24)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: WONT - Terminal Type (0x18) <- response to my DO command above (I
never get a DONT though)

R: SB - Terminal Type (0x18) - SEND - SE
S: SB - '' - IS - VT220 - SE

R: WILL - Suppress Go Ahead (0x03)
S: DO - ''
S: WILL - ''

R: DO - Echo (0x01)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: DO - Negotiate About Window Size (0x1F)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: WILL - Status (0x05)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: DO - Remote Flow Control (0x21)
S: WONT - ''
S: DONT - ''

R: DO - Suppress Go Ahead (0x03) <- reply to my WILL

R: WILL - Echo (0x01)
S: DO - ''

Immediately after all of this, it sends the header, "SCO OpenServer(TM)
Release 5 (mestamed.mscusa) (ttype17)", then after a few CRLF's, the
logon prompt "login:"

Then it closes the socket.

Looking at this, the only thing I don't know about is the
command "WILL - STATUS".  I was under the impression that this should
be a reply for a "DO" from me.  However, I never send a "DO - STATUS"
to the server.

Once again, thank you for all the help.

You are making a fundamental error in that you do not understand
how to implement the state machine.  Read:

  ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1143.txt

You do not reply DONT to a DO; and you do not reply WONT to a WILL.

: R: DO - Authentication Option (0x25)
: S: WONT - ''
: S: DONT - ''

Here the SCO machine is asking your client to DO telnet authentication.
Since your client doesn't understand AUTH you respond WONT.  Since the 
host never offered to perform AUTH it is already in a state of WONT;
therefore, you do not send DONT.

: R: DO - Terminal Type (0x18)
: S: WILL - ''
: S: DO - ''<- will be ignored by server later

The DO will not be ignored.  It will be refused.  But you shouldn't be 
sending the DO.  A server cannot perform terminal type negotiations 
in that direction.  So don't request it.

: R: DO - Terminal Speed (0x20)
: S: WONT - ''
: S: DONT - ''
: 
: R: DO - X Display Location (0x23)
: S: WONT - ''
: S: DONT - ''
: 
: R: DO - New Environment Option (0x27)
: S: WONT - ''
: S: DONT - ''
: 
: R: DO - Environment Option (0x24)
: S: WONT - ''
: S: DONT - ''

Same for all of the above.  ....

: R: WONT - Terminal Type (0x18) <- response to my DO command above (I
: never get a DONT though)

You don't want a DONT.  You said you wanted to perform Terminal Type
negotations.  

: R: SB - Terminal Type (0x18) - SEND - SE
: S: SB - '' - IS - VT220 - SE

This is correct.

: R: WILL - Suppress Go Ahead (0x03)
: S: DO - ''
: S: WILL - ''

This is correct because you must negotiate SGA unless you are planning
on sending GA commands.

: R: DO - Echo (0x01)
: S: WONT - ''
: S: DONT - ''

This will cause you serious problems.  Remember, by the time that you
are replying to the DO ECHO, the host may have already sent the WILL
ECHO you receive later.  Therefore, your DONT ECHO which should not
be sent will be interpretted as a response to the WILL ECHO.  This
is going to be interpretted as a request to turn ECHO off in both
directions.  This is often interpretted as an attempt to use the poor
man's linemode which may not be supported by the telnet server.
Hence, you hang your connection.

: R: DO - Negotiate About Window Size (0x1F)

You are lacking a basic understanding on what RFC 855 says and have
not read the RFCs for the STATUS option.  The STATUS option is offered
by the server; not the client.

Subject: Re: SCO UNIX emulation help


Thank you for the detailed information.  It seems I made the fatal flaw
early on in thinking the previous owner of the code knew what he was
doing and I did not check his code or the RFC's as thoroughly as I
should have...

In any case, I got the RFC's you mentioned, especially RFC1143 and I
believe I have implemented this correctly now.  However the problem is
still happening.

The only commands I am interested in is the Suppress Go Ahead, Terminal
Type, and Echo.  For all the others, when I recieve a DO, I reply with
a WONT.  This should put both of un in the correct state.

The WILL I recieve for Status is replied with a DONT since we do not
agree that he should enable this command.

In the case of the Echo, when I recieve a DO, since I do not want to
echo his commands, I send a WONT only.  When I recieve the WILL, I then
confirm that with a DO so I can see what I've sent to him.

I no longer ask the server his Terminal Type and since, other than the
SGA, I am replying back one at a time, there shouldn't be a loop
present that might have happened in the previous implementation.

I believe it is happy with the Terminal Type I give it since it does
not ask for it a second time and the negotiation about the SGA command
seems to follow the RFC correctly.  I respond with a DO to confirm his
WILL and he does the same to me.

However, SCO is still closing the socket.  Apparently it still does not
like my replies.  I am positive I have the correct combination with
WILL/DONT and DO/WONT.  Could there be some other command that I should
be treating specifically other than the above 3?

Are there any freeware VT emulators that can log both sides of the
Telnet transactions that I might try running to see what they do that's
so different from me?

Again, I really appreciate the help.  I got stuck with this project
when the previous owner left and unfortunately, knowledge about Telnet
protocols and host emulation in general is scarce at best...

Thank you.

Since you have access to Unix Telnet you can simply turn on option

  SET TELNET DEBUG ON

Thanks.  I'll take a look.

I'm currently pushing my boss and the IS department to getting me a
copy of SCO so we can have it installed here at the office so I can
actually have a test system.  Actually...I've been asking for an AS/400
too since we integrate with RUMBA and Client Access....we'll see.

I took a look at the log generated but right now, unfortunately, the
Linux box I installed Kermit on does not have a modem and I can't dial
into the customer that has SCO.  I connected to our Solaris machine and
got the log to just take a look at it and the only difference seems to
be that it's willing to send the New Environment stuff, they send the
Window Size, and they use the command KERMIT.

I did notice however that it sends WILL for NAWS, Term Type and New
Env. at the server before it recieves anything.  Then later the server
replies with DO's.  This should not make a difference in my case
right?  I don't initiate any negotiations.  Everything I do is started
in the form of a reply to a DO or WILL that was sent to me.

So that is where I am right now.  Looking to see if we can get a modem
installed on the LINUX box, looking to see if we can get a copy of SCO,
and in the meantime, trying out some other things like sending the
Window Size and so forth.

I really appreciate all the help you've given me.  It's made taking
over this project a bit more tolerable than it would have been if I had
no help and no resources and I had to try to figure out what was
happening from just the original code (...which was bad to begin
with...).

Thank you.

Subject: Re: Can't get Linux telnet client to disable line mode

The normal mode of TELNET is that all options are disabled.  In other
words, you should not sent any DONT/WONT options unless:
 1) you wish to disable an option that you previously agreed to with
    DO/WILL.
 2) you wish to refuse a WILL/DO change request from the client.

So, you should not send DONT ECHO and DONT LINEMODE, because you are
already in that mode.  Also, a compliant TELNET implementation will ignore
such things.

Also, it's silly for a TELNET client to ever send WILL ECHO, or for a
TELNET server to ever send DO ECHO.  It is only meaningful for a client
to send DO/DONT ECHO and a server to send WILL/WONT ECHO.

Getting TELNET protocol right is something that trips up newbies every
time.  I strongly suggest that you get a good pedagogical book about
TCP/IP protocols.

The VAX is behaving correctly.  The "WILL ECHO" message implies a
change of state (default is all options off; this is informing the
peer that one of the local options was turned on).  The "DONT ECHO"
message requests that the state be changed back, so, again, there is a
change of state (from on back to off), so a "WONT ECHO" message is
required.  This is described on page 2 of RFC 854.

That's probably a system issue outside of the TELNET protocol.
Disabling ECHO using "DONT ECHO" should stop the peer from echoing
back characters it receives.  If it doesn't do that, then the peer is
broken.

James,

Thanks for responding.

I have read RFC 854, I got the impression that state changes were not
permitted unless agreed.  Therefore WILL ECHO does not represent a
state change and does not require and acceptance of change back with
WONT ECHO.  Doesn't the RFC state that communications shouldn't simply
be used to announce state change?

I am still a bit confused on this one. Is it that a refusal always
requires three components:  WILL, DONT, WONT or DO, WONT, DONT ?
Whereas an acceptance only requires two WILL, DO or DO, WILL?  

Can't find this information in the RFC.

Thanks Bill.

No.  It says that you cannot send a request to announce what mode you
are *already* in, but if you're *changing* mode, then you must send a
request.

In other words, when you first come up, you must not send any "DONT
foo" or "WONT foo" messages.  The default for all options is off, so
these are redundant announcements.  Only the options that change state
should be sent.

No, that's not it.  "DO" and "DONT" just request state change on the
other side of the link.  Nothing is actually changed until the peer
responds.  "WILL" and "WONT" mean that the local state *has* changed,
and must be inserted in the data stream at the point where the mode
change takes place.  Any data that follows either of these messages
must be encoded in the 'new' format (whatever that means for the given
option).  This does imply that a system sending an unsolicited WILL
when the option is off must buffer the user-level data, rather than
encode and transmit it, until the peer responds with a DO or DONT
(which the peer is required to do).  This is what's meant by avoiding
the "uncertainty period" at the top of page 3.  In our implementation,
I wait 30 seconds for this to happen.

Sadly, there are many (mostly PC-based) implementations of TELNET that
get this exchange wrong and fail to respond to WILL messages as
required by the RFC.

So reasonable and complete exchanges (assuming 'opt' is initially off) are:


 1.     DO opt (requests change of state; must be answered) ->
                        <- WILL opt (agreeing to change; option now in
                                     effect)

 2.     DO opt (requests change of state; must be answered) ->
                        <- WONT opt (not agreeing to change; option still
                                     not in effect)

 3.     WILL opt (implies change of state; must be answered) ->
                        <- DO opt (agree to change already in effect)

 4.     WILL opt (implies change of state; must be answered) ->
                        <- DONT opt (not agreeing to change)
        WONT opt (buffering off) ->


With 'opt' initially on:

 1.     DONT opt (requests change of state) ->
                        <- WONT opt (option is disabled)

 2.     WONT opt (implies change of state) ->


It is required that all implementations support any or all options
disabled, so it's not too reasonable to force an option back on if the
peer disables it.

Subject: Re: Simple Telnet Help!

Thanks that clears up the process enough for the implementation, however
I do have one or two questions about the validity of the process...

WONT and DONT on startup I am aware of.. redundant--all options are
off this seems fine and reasonable.

And when a local change is announced with a WILL, it is pre-empting
the peer's acceptance of the change (and buffering to cover up the
uncertainty period).

The peer is not required to accept the change, a valid response would
be DONT foo.  When the peer sends DONT foo, the local change is
rejected and the locally buffered change of state must be
undone(redone). To all intense and purpose the state (from the point
of view of the peer) never changed. The side of the link that sent the
original WILL has had its local state change denied.

It is at this point I am confused (duh). As it would not seem sensible
for the originator of the WILL to respond to this denial (DONT) with a
WILL again, it *must* respond WONT, it has no choice and therefore it
would seem that the response is as redundant as sending DONT/WONT on
startup.

The peer has already said it will not agree to the option, it does not
need to wait for a conformation of its own refusal--on the grounds
that it is not required to implement the option and has not changed
state.

I can see how always sending a WONT when a DONT is received could
simplify the state model, because currently I process WILL(remote
unsolicited)/DONT(response) as separate set of state changes which
cause the overall state to return to an option off state--which will
ignore the final WONT ( remote response--which I hadn't really
expected to get) as it would an unsolicited WONT on startup.

Bill.

Yes, it's still needed.  As I said, there's no demand in the RFC that
the peer buffer the data after sending the WILL, and there's also no
demand that the receiver attempt to handle such foreign data.

Suppose, for instance, the WILL option in question is going to
translate everything from ASCII into EBCDIC, and that the peer doesn't
buffer its output.  Do you still want to deliver this data even if you
don't speak EBCDIC?  What will the user think of this?  Some options
are somewhat benign, but others aren't.

As with all kludges for interoperability with broken peers (the ones
that send WONT willy-nilly without regard to where it takes effect),
this one should have a switch on it if possible.

Staying compatible with all of the dumb things people have done over
the years is tough, but it makes for a pretty decent living.  ;-}

Make sure you have:

line .....
 telnet break-on-ip

After that use TN_INTERRUPT_PROCESS signal.
It's usually mapped to a key in a telnet client, for example
Ctrl-F5 in CRT.

Best.

I just found that.  It doesn't seem to work with my

No.  A VT220 does not support arbitrary window sizes.  The
fixed sizes the VT220 supports are all greater than or equal to 80 x 24.

One thing you can try doing is to position the cursor at the
bottom right corner and then request a Cursor Position Report:

  Request DSR   CSI 6

  Report  CSR   CSI Pl; Pc R   where Pl is line number; Pc is column

Try sending the cursor to a line and column larger than any likely to
exist:

CSI 999 ; 999 H

Then request the cursor position: CSI 6 n

and read the report, which will tell you the real maximum.

I'm a little confused as to how you expect a telnet server to interpret
this though; the telnet negotiations and ANSI terminal controls are
working on different levels.

Well i admit i don't really know what i am doing but i can
send stuff like ^[h and then cursor will go to the home

Thank you! That was it. Is this FAQ material? The inetd and telnet man

The source code, and the BSD manpages for rcmd(3) and rshd(8) are
probably the best bet.

From the client's point of view:

  1. client binds two reserved ports (port numbers <1024)

  2. client connects from one reserved port to the server, and sends a
     NUL-terminated ASCII decimal string giving the other port number

  3. client listens on other port for incoming connection from the
     server. (some degree of paranoia is appropriate here, though the
     whole protocol is sufficiently insecure as to require very careful
     handling; the source port is expected to be <1024 but should not be
     port 20 to avoid FTP-based attacks). This auxiliary connection is
     used later for stderr and signals

  Alternatively the client can send 0 or an empty string as the port
  number, in which case no second connection is established.  

  4. client sends NUL-terminated ASCII string giving the username as
     used on the client

  5. client sends NUL-terminated ASCII string giving the username as
     desired on the server

  6. client sends NUL-terminated ASCII string giving the command string
     to be executed on the server

  7. client reads one character from the main connection. If it's a
     NUL, then the request was successful. If not, the client should
     read more characters from the main connection until EOF and treat
     it as an error message, and abort everything at that point.

  8. At this point the main connection becomes stdin/stdout for the
     invoked command, and the auxiliary connection is stderr. Signals
     can be sent to the command as single-byte values written to the
     auxiliary connection (yes, this assumes that you know what the
     signal numbers are on the server side - numbers 1-15 are standard,
     but for anything else you're on your own).

     The connections persist as long as the remote command keeps them
     open. No indication of the termination (or exit status) of the
     remote command is given.

Yeah, but you need netcat on both sides. The ssh/rsh/telnet/whatever
method works as soon as you have any sort of remote tty access to the
machine and a bare minimum of posix tools (i.e. dd or even sh+cat). And
it comes quite handy if you are on a machine where the *%^(&@ admin
managed to screw up scp and the like.

Again, it's not *all* you can do.  Kermit is a Telnet client that can
transfer files over its own Telnet connection:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/

This answers the original poster's question about how to transfer a file
over a Telnet connection.

Such questions always quickly veer off-topic when answered by "don't use
Telnet, use ssh or scp", but let's not be too quick to condemn trusty old
FTP and Telnet.  First of all, they are not *inherently* insecure.  Secure
versions of both are available:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/telnetd.html

as well as secure clients.

Second, these secure versions of Telnet and FTP use reliable, standard,
and manageable security methods such as Kerberos 4 and 5, SSL/TSL, and
SRP, rather than SSH, which has some rather serious flaws and risks that
everybody likes to overlook, simply because SSH is easy to install.
It's not far off the mark to say the "easier" the security method, the
greater the risks.

Third, Telnet continues to offer many convenience features not found in
the alternatives, via its extensive and fully standardized negotiation
and in-band command mechanism.

At the moment we recommend SSL/TLS, SRP, or Kerberos 4 or 5, none of
which have the vulnerabilities of SSH.  Of course we provide clients for
these security methods, and servers are listed here:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/telnetd.html

We also have our own server that supports these methods:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/cuiksd.html

Of course the problem with centrally managed security schemes is that they
are difficult to set up.  The high startup cost, however, pays off down
the road when security violations actually occur.  Since identities are
kept centrally in a safe place, rather than on PC hard disks all over the
Internet, security violations can be handled centrally too, by revoking
identities or certificates.  Distributed methods such as SSH are
unmanageable by their very nature.  If you have keys on your PC for 100
hosts all over the net, and somebody steals your key file and decrypts it
offline, they have access to all 100 hosts.  Suppose this happens while
you are away on vacation.  The network security team at your site has no
way of cleaning up this mess.  After this kind of thing happens a few
times, they might wish they had taken the trouble to institute a more
manageable security scheme.

The backwards questions marks denote parity errors, which are probably
caused by loss of synchronization -- the PC is sending faster than the
terminal handle.  The PC and terminal need to be configured to use the
same kind of flow control.  Since the only form of flow control the terminal
supports is Xon/Xoff, you'll need to set the Linux ports to use it too.

The problem was solved by simply using agetty instead of mgetty. 
Apparently, mgetty does not support Xon/Xoff [flow control], even
though you can "turn it on" using stty.

What, *exactly*, do you mean by "a break"?

There is a Telnet Break command (IAC BRK), and a Telnet Interrupt
Process command (IAC IP). Which do you want?

 Dennis> I've tried just sending a char code 127 - that doesn't work.

127 is just a character like any other, as far as Telnet is concerned.

The only time you should ever use OOB (out of band) data on Telnet is
when sending the Synch sequence (IAC DM).

Microsoft's Telnet service, assuming it even runs on Windows 98, is of
very limited utility. As a telnet service it is incomplete, and add to 
that the fact that a bare bones Windows 9x system doesn't provide much 
utility at the comand line

At least nothing I would want to leverage.

Windows 98 is architectually different than Windows NT/2000/XP so 
various useful console-based utilities that provide system information, 
e.g., the PsTools suite from systernals.com, have little or no context there.

A better bet would be to use VNC:

    http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/

VNC gives you a remote view of your GUI desktop. It's like sitting there 
from afar.

Subject: Regarding Windows 2000 information

Richard,

On your web page at
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/system_terminal_setup.html
you assert that the Windows 2000 telnet service will only accept NTLM.
This is in fact, not exactly correct.

The telnet client is set up originally to only accept NTLM, but if you
go into configure it (under Administrative Tools, choose option 3 for
"Display / change registry settings ..." then option 7 for "NTLM"
[you will find] it is set to 2.

If you set this to 1, it will try [first] for NTLM, but if that is not
available it will revert to plain-text entry like a normal Unix telnet
service would request;  if the parameter is 0, it will not try to use
NTLM at all, and you will get something like this:
 
Microsoft (R) Windows (TM) Version 5.00 (Build 2195)
Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Service
Telnet Server Build 5.00.99201.1
login:
 
 
But then again, as the Win2K professional client only has 1 telnet access
license, it does still fall short of what you would really want ;-)

Hope this helps,
Kieran McDonnell.

You've run out of pseudo ttys (pty's).

(As root)

Edit /etc/system and add:

set pt_cnt = <number>   (something like 400 should do it)

Then

    # touch /reconfigure

and reboot.

Subject: term emulation detecting the end of remote send

i need to implement a (pseudo) terminal emulation.
for the time being, to exercicize me, i'm working with telnet.

basically what i don't understand is the way to detect the remote host
(thru telnet) has finished sending something.

for the time being i'm using the prompt:
when i get the prompt (something like "/path/to/pwd #") at the beginning
of a transmitted line (then after a \n) i assume i have hand to transmit
another command.

is there a special control sequence saying telnet has finished sennding
and is ready to accept a new command ?

fine, thanks, then, the only way to know telnet has finished is using
a timeout...

but, how to avoid hanging after the last getc ?

because i think i need to "kil"" last getc in order being able to putc
???

I wouldn't know; I'm not much of a Unix guy.

I suspect this is the sort of thing folks use threads and/or

I don't think so because, if using telnet, outputting, for example :

    ls -AL

telnet will answer with the content of the directory followed by the
prompt, like that :

/ # cd /mnt/fat/4tt
/mnt/fat/4tt # ls -Al
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          305 Aug 12 11:39 check_db_md5.sh
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          341 Aug  8 09:11
remove_file_mtime.ash
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          409 Aug 13 18:37 write_db_md5.sh
/mnt/fat/4tt #

ending with "/mnt/fat/4tt # "

then, with a spacen no NL

it sounds strange to me there is no sequence saying "end of
transmission"...

finally i get it working with a timeout...

It's because shell sessions of this type are not really intended to
be processed by machines. The command prompt is displayed for a
human to read, and a human knows when they've seen the prompt partly
by timeout, partly by knowing what the prompt is supposed to look
like, and partly by context (allowing them to disambiguate, say, a
"$ " at what ought to be the end of their previous command's output
from a "$ " half way through it).

If you're trying to set up an automated means of issuing shell
commands to a remote machine, then you should probably be doing it
using a mechanism actually designed for the job. For instance, the
SSH protocol has a robust mechanism for sending a single command,
having it executed, and sending back notification when it terminates
so that you can check its error code and send another command. No
timeout would be required in this case, and also there would be no
need to parse a prompt out of the incoming data in the first place.
However, Telnet in particular is not well equipped with mechanisms
of this type.

(As a minor point of interest, there is a Telnet "End Of Record"
code which _is_ used in some circumstances to delimit the end of a
prompt. However, it's generally only used in MUDs and talkers, where
it permits a dedicated MUD client to tell the difference between a
line of output which should be displayed in an output window, and a
prompt which should be displayed in an input window. I don't know of
any kind of Telnet server which uses the same mechanism for a
general command shell, although in principle an operating system
could provide a means to do so if it really wanted to.)

Make sure telnet is enabled like this:  "svcadm enable telnet"

A better answer would be to download putty.exe and connect to Solaris
via ssh.

He is using Solaris 9 which does not use svcadm ...

I am unsure if you mean you are trying to telnet from the PC into the
Solaris box, or you are going from the Solaris box into the PC. However,
because this is a Solaris question I expect its the former.


Off the top of my head:

Check that telnet is actually enabled in Solaris 9.

i) edit the file /etc/inetd.conf to see if the telnet line is commented
   out with a #.  If so, then remove the '#'.

ii) If so, then restart inetd using the command:   kill -HUP inetd

iii) verify that you are telnetting to the correct IP address of the
    Solaris box. To check the IP address on solaris type:

    ifconfig -a

The output might be similar to this:

eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:11:2a:f6:eb:4a
          inet addr: 10.93.20.121  Bcast:10.93.20.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::201:4aff:fef6:eb1a/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:24301 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:24542 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:18329526 (17.4 MB)  TX bytes:3660300 (3.4 MB)
          Interrupt:18

The  inet addr: 10.93.20.121  IP address is yours. I expect that it
might have been assigned something like 192.168.n.n by VMware.


(the -a lists all of the network interfaces.)

I *presume* you mean that you're on the PC running the "telnet"
command trying to connect to the Solaris box.

Coz it's a little unclear ... from the way you stated it, you
might be on the Solaris box running the "telnet" command trying
to connect to the PC.

If that's the case, I'm not sure if the PC even comes with a
Telnet Daemon.  If it does, you need to activate it, probably
deep in Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Services.  If it
doesn't, you need to find one and install it.  They are
available free for download with a few minutes web searching.
