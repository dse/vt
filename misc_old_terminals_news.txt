According to

    http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/7tape.html

several Flexowriters used a 6-bit code with upper/lower shift.

Ah, this shows 5-bit versions too:

How many such devices existed in 1908 or earlier? ;-)

The 'Compose' key is for creating high-order ascii characters, and other
ascii characters not on the keyboard. To use it, you must operate the
terminal in an eight-bit environment, and be using the VT in VT220 mode.
Put simply, you compose an accented character by a two or three character
sequence, e.g. for A-umlaut you would type COMPOSE A ", for c-cedilla type
COMPOSE c , ... for GB pound sign it's COMPOSE l =, for Japanese yen it's
COMPOSE Y =. Most of the accented characters are fairly easy to guess once
you understand the principle of 'combining' the ascii characters.

>Can I 'save' stuff to the

The contents of the function keys are host-writable, but the VT220 loses the
settings when turned off. You could look at the ANSWERBACK field though.

>Are there
>any roms out there for Japanese characters sets? 

The character matrix on the VT220 is a bit too crude to allow much in the
way of Japanese, as the chinese root symbols that most of Japanese starts
words with are too complex to the represented properly. Terminals such as
the VT320 have more complex character matrices.

The VT220 is a text-only terminal. A quick guide as to the main differences
between the VT terminals follows:

Terminal	Extended Mono	Colour	Redefinable  Refresh Dual Host
		keybd?	 Graph? Graph?  characters?  rate    (2 sessions)?

VT52		No	 No	No	No	     60Hz    No
VT100		No	 No	No	No	     60Hz    No
VT125		No	 Yes	No	No	     60Hz    No
VT220		Yes	 No	No	Yes	     60Hz    No
VT230		Yes	 Yes	No	Yes	     60Hz    No
VT240		Yes	 No	Yes	Yes	     60Hz    No
VT320		Yes	 No	No	Yes	     60Hz    No
VT330		Yes	 Yes	No	Yes	     60Hz    Yes	**
VT340		Yes	 No	Yes	Yes	     60Hz    Yes	**
VT420		Yes	 No	No	Yes	     70Hz    Yes	**
VT1000		Yes	 Yes 	(Monochrome X-windows terminal)
VT1200		Yes	 Yes	(Monochrome X-windows terminal)		**
VT1300		Yes   	 No	Yes (Colour X-windows terminal)		**

All VT100-400 terminals are ANSI X3.41-1977 and X.3.64-1979 compliant.
VTx30 and x40 terminals use Regis graphics, which can provide bitmapped
displays. The VT340 display is very similar to EGA. Terminals marked with
** are current digital terminals.

The only place that I know to get the vt102 escape sequences is by getting a
copy of the manual from DEC. I have a copy of the vt100 manual that seems to
cover the additional commands for the vt102. You might try checking the
termcap files on your systems. I found that my Sun workstation did not have
one for the vt102; so I modified the vt100 entry to make one. I have listed it
below. I hope this is useful.

...paraphrased...

   This person would like to know what escape sequence most VT100 clones
   will handle.  Here's my two cents; I'd love to know what everybody
   else does.

Well, there's no canonical list, but here's what to avoid:

    1) Down loaded characters (for obvious reasons)
    2) All ESC-# sequences (eg, double wide characters).
       This also applies to ESC # 8, DECALN (fill screen with E's)
    3) ESC 7/ ESC 8.  These are cursor save/restore.  You'd think
       these would be easy, but both xterm and some of the Sun
       text windows do them wrong.
    4) Most of the settings.  In particular, don't assume that you
       can go into 132 column mode, and don't assume you can set
       reverse video.
    5) ESc[q.  Sigh.  ESC[145q was so much fun.
    6) Out of range parameters.  This is especially true of window-
       based terminal emulators which tend to not check out of range
       arguments.
    7) ESC[m.  Different terminals implement different values; you
       can probably get away with using ESC[7m and ESC[0m.

I'm curious what "device identification codes" exist among DEC terminals;
so far I have:

Funnily enough, the DECterm id *is* documented - in the VT1200 guide ...

Procomm version 2.4.3's VT100 emulation works just fine with our SunOS 4.1
Unix and MicroVax Ultrix systems, GNU Emacs, curses, etc., with one
exception:  their emulation defaults to "Origin Mode=Relative" instead of
"Origin mode=Absolute" like every VT100 I know of.  This can be fixed by
putting

  if ($TERM == VT100)  echo -n '^[[?6l'    (where ^[ means ESCape)

in your .login, or an equivalent statement in your .profile.  Procomm runs at
least up to 9600, and I forget offhand if it goes faster.  Procomm also
supports a variety of up/download protocols.

If you want super-top-notch-whiz-bang-complete VT100 emulation, get a copy of
KERMIT.  It supports practically most features of VT340s and VT102s.
Kermit's user interface will feel more primitive, and it only supports the
kermit file transfer protocol, but it works and it's free.

   Hi, everyone.
   Ever heard about arabic terminals ?
   I'm writing an arabic terminal emulator for Mac. It actually emulates the 
dku7140 (Bull & Integro). I'm extending the program so it may emaulte other 
teminals such as :
- ALIS (by ALIS Tech).
- ALTRAK (by Alphacrete).
both of them are arabic ANSI (vt100,vt200) terminals.

My questions are:
 Does anyone know about manuals for these terminals (especially for ALIS). The
 one which I have doesn't speak about arabic features. 

 Do you know if there is any other types of arabic terminals ?.
 Do you know if there are hebrow terminals ? ( I think integrating them won't
 be difficult).

 Thaks for your help.

The icon on it is something like <=] partkey of vt320 to send backspace? DEL?

A: Send ESC[?67l to make <=] send DEL
   Send ESC[?67h to make it send BackSpace.

The following CSH script in unix may turn useful for switching
between the two modes.

	if ($?DEL) then
		stty erase "^?"	
		echo "[?67l"

Well, this isn't by email, but I would like someone to point out if I am wrong! 
You can send things to the printer port using <ctrl>-PF1 and <shift>-PF1 I
believe.  One of them toggles output so that it all goes to the printer port in
addition to the screen, the other sends the current line (screen?) to the
printer port.  Sorry- don't have a manual in front of me, and I haven't used a
VTxxx terminal in three years (ever since I got a VS 3200...).

Sounds like the sources for "gifview" are needed here. It's got all the stuff
you'd need to fix up your M-set prog to save on redundant characters...
unfortunately, it'd probably be best outputting it into an intermediate
stage so the image display can be done after all the computation is
finished. That way you won't have any problems with having to estimate
how big the image should be, as it's unlikely, even for a full -2 to 2
view of the set, to get it displaying full-screen - 96 characters don't go
very far, especially where boundaries between shades are involved.

>BTW, I usually run it on a batch que with output to a file!

No surprises there :-) Thankfully, the gifview optimising process doesn't
take the 5 minutes I originally envisaged... only about 30 seconds to
work it out and 5 to display it on a fairly slow machine.

PS: Come to think of it, I might post it here if people want to see it.
If you're interested, send me some mail expressing just that! I think
I've ironed out almost all of the bugs, with only glitches left, so
it's safe for a test release. I'd better get writing a manpage
and fixing up comments and the like. It runs on (I'd guess) any UNIX
platform safely, seeing as it uses only stdio calls. In fact, it could
be hacked up to run on ANY platform, seeing as it only _needs_ to
output to a terminal and nothing more!

I have a VT220 terminal that had a display problem.  The image (charcters
on the screen) used to wiggle side to side from time to time.  Took the
cover off, and found that the pot marked something like "horiz hold"
seemed dirty.  When I rotated it some, the wiggle problem would clear
for a while.  Got tired of having to do this every so often, so I replaced
this pot.  No more wiggles since I did this a week ago.
BTW, when I got this terminal, the display was not horiz sync-ing at all.
Cleared that by playing with this pot.  This bad pot caused the reason
why I was given this terminal in the first place.

This pot is the one inside the display, on the left side, closest to the 
front.  You have to take the back cover off to see it.  It's just a cheap
trimpot type.  5K ohms.  4.7K will also work.  Try to measure the old
pot with an ohmeter to verify this though.
This may be all that's wrong with that VT220 sitting in the back room.

 John,
 I spend a LOT of my time resurrecting dead/near dead terminals
 for our poverty-stricken college environment..
 If you're prepared to pull the back off, you'll find a coupla
 little wheels.. They should be marked, so just find the appropriate
 one and tweak it a bit.. probably won't require much..


From: berglin@sscux1.ssc.gov (robert berglin)

 Try opening the case and cleaning out the dust, especially from the high
 voltage "stinger" lead that goes into the side of the CRT.  If you've not
 ever done something like this, you may want to find someone who has;  you
 should always use something like a screwdriver to discharge the CRT by working
 the tip under the protective cap where the high voltage lead goes in to the
 CRT, and laying the shaft of the scredriver against the monitor's chassis.
 The monitor is then relatively safe to work on (don't forget to unplug it).


From: edotto@uipsuxb.ps.uiuc.edu (Edward C. Otto III)

 1) Take it to your local TV repair shop and have them de-gas the tube.
 Involves taking the cover off and attaching a machine to the yoke on the
 CRT.  Should cost around $30.

 2) While they are in there, have them do two things:
 	A) Check the HVAC to see that it's corect, and have them adjust
 	   it if it isn't;
 	B) Have them degauss the tube (not de-gas -= this involves
           using a magnetic instrument to remove residual magnetic
 	   fields from the front and sides of the tube).

 This should fix it.


From: pat@warren.mit.edu

 VR260 Monitor Owner:
 Remove the back cover of the monitor.  There are 3 (I think) knobs which
 adjust the focus, vertical size, and horizontal size of the monitor area.
 Open a few windows on the monitor at upper lhs, middle, and lower rhs for
 example, and adjust the focus until you get a reasonable compromise of focus
 across the open windows.  I did this and had great results.

Heya,

	A couple of weeks ago I asked how one goes about getting the
	sun4 keypad to put out the escape sequences for the vt100 keys
	(like PF1 and its ilk)

	I got lots of responses, and thanks to everyone who made
	suggestions.

	There were several suggestions that indicated xmodmap.
	Unfortunately, I didn't want to remap the keyboard for all
	windows, only for a couple that were unfortunate enough to have
	to access a VAX.

	The solution I settled on uses the translation resource in
	xterm.  Here's what you do:

1) add the following lines to your .Xdefaults file (note that the first
   character of each of these `string' commands is an ESC (^[), so if it
   got nuked in transit, this won't work.  I'll put a uuencoded version of
   this at the bottom of this message just in case.):

----cut here----
XTerm*vt100.translations: 	#override \
   !Shift <Key>R1:		keymap(vt100)
XTerm*vt100Keymap.translations:	#override \
   <Key>R4:				string("OP")\n\
   <Key>R5:				string("OQ")\n\
   <Key>R6:				string("OR")\n\
   <Key>KP_Subtract:	string("OS")\n\
   Shift<Key>KP_2:		string("B")\n\
   Shift<Key>KP_4:		string("D")\n\
   Shift<Key>KP_6:		string("C")\n\
   Shift<Key>KP_8:		string("A")\n\
   <Key>KP_0:			string("Op")\n\
   <Key>KP_1:			string("Oq")\n\
   <Key>KP_2:			string("Or")\n\
   <Key>KP_3:			string("Os")\n\
   <Key>KP_4:			string("Ot")\n\
   <Key>KP_5:			string("Ou")\n\
   <Key>KP_6:			string("Ov")\n\
   <Key>KP_7:			string("Ow")\n\
   <Key>KP_8:			string("Ox")\n\
   <Key>KP_9:			string("Oy")\n\
   <Key>KP_Decimal:		string("On")\n\
   <Key>KP_Add:			string("Ol")\n\
   <Key>R2:				string("Om")\n\
   <Key>KP_Enter:		string("OM")\n\
   !Shift <Key>R1:		keymap(None)
----cut here----

2) use xrdb to get the window manager to notice that something was
   changed

xrdb ~/.Xdefaults

3) start up an xterm.

Once the xterm starts up, if you type Shift-R1, it turns on the vt100
keymap which remaps the type 4 keypad to look like this:

+---------------------------+
|      |      |Scroll| Num  |
|Pause |  ,   |Lock/ | Lock |
|      |      |Break |      |
|------+------+------+------|
|      |      |      |      |
| PF1  | PF2  | PF3  | PF4  |
|      |      |      |      |
|------+------+------+------|
|      |      |      |      |
|  7   |  8   |  9   |      |
|      |      |      |      |
|------+------+------+  -   |
|      |      |      |      |
|  4   |  5   |  6   |      |
|      |      |      |      |
|------+------+------+------|
|      |      |      |      |
|  1   |  2   |  3   |  E   |
|      |      |      |  n   |
|------+------+------+  t   |
|             |      |  e   |
|      0      |  .   |  r   |
|             |      |      |
+---------------------------+

When shifted, 8, 4, 6, and 2 return the usual cursor motion codes.

Note that only the current xterm is affected.  If you start up a new
one, it will come up with the original keys and you'll have to press
Shift-R1 to get it to use the vt100 bindings.

Pressing Shift-R1 again returns the normal keypad.

If anyone wants a copy of all the mail I got, send me email.

Thanks again to everyone who offered suggestions.

Hi, netters,

I asked about the VT100 graphics code before and some guys send me helpful 
hints on that.  However,  I found a ftp site that has several VT100 animation
files that some of you (not-gurus) will be interested in.  The files can be 
got from anon ftp site: ftp.irisa.fr (131.254.254.2) in the directory 
/pub/vt100.  I think the ".FR" in the site name stand for France, so please 
ftp them after the 6 p.m. local time.  

Another thing I'd like to share with you is in order to get the contrl sequence 
in editing you own graphics file,  you can use the EDT and press <ctrl>33, 
remember to press 3 twice while pressing down the <ctrl> key.  I learnt this 
from another post to info-vax but sorry I cannot refer to his name.

A good way to explore the graphics code of VT100 is edit the following lines
replace the <ESC> with the real escape code you got from <ctrl>33.

<ESC>(0  <------ turn the terminal to grphics mode
type in any keys that you are interested in their graphic corresponds.
i.e 	a b c d ... 
<ESC>(B  <------ turn the terminal back to text mode

if you got mess up on your terminal, simply RESET it in the setup menu or turn
it off and restart it.

Have fun

Yang

   usually a semicolon (;). The bit combination 3/10 is
   reserved for future standardization.

   In each parameter leading bit combinations of 3/0 are not
   significant and may be omitted. A zero length parameter
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   or one consisting only of 3/0 bit combinations represents
   a default whose value depends upon the control function."
     ^^^^^^^

The spec then goes on to say in section 5.77 on Select Graphic Rendition
to say the default value for a parameter to the SGR is 3/0.


I would interpret the section on parameter values to say that the
cases of

   CSI 7 ; m

and

   CSI 7 ; 0 m

yield the same result. The second parameter has no length in the first
case, thus it defaults to 3/0, whereas in the second case the second parameter
is explicitly 3/0.

The wrinkles you noted are covered by the definition qouted above.

Hope this helps, and it would be nice to hear other's interpretations as well.
However, when it comes to emulating a specific terminal I always side in favor
of what the hardware does... usually.

I recently asked for information about getting an X-terminal for home-use.
My sincere thanks to many helpful netters for their advice.  But my impression
is that getting an X-terminal for home use is not very affordable, with that
kind of money, I can get a 486 or even a low-end workstation from Sun or HP.

Here are the responses I received.  Once again, thanks alot!

The X-Remote protocol will also be shipped in the next versions of PC-XView
or so I have been told. Given the Price of X-Terms I would definitly think
in terms of a 386-25 with 8514 video and lots of Memory. Note the 8514 card
is probably better than buying a fastermother board since your ISA architecture
will limit screen I/O as well as your serial link. Also a PC system will give
you a resonable standalone capacity which an XTerm lacks. PC-XView is a DOS
based X-Server and so does not have the Overhead associated with MS-Windoze.
I would start with 8 Meg, 8514 card PC-XView and the fastest modems I can find
for the line, add as much processor as I can then afford with a small hard disk
(Which can be replaced later or go NFS to your SCO box). Should cost you a lot
less than a proper X-Term.

One other bit of advice is to try conecting up a serial link at work and 
then Run X over that. SLIP at 19.2 is not good when you are used to Ethernet.

I have the docs for these machines, and use three of them around here, on
Plex-1 and Plex-2. They are very nice and easy to work with. You can mail
me at anyone of the addresses below (fastest=plex-1) and I will help you 
set your tvi950's up, the docs are too large to copy and mail off.

Re yer TV950 doc-help wanted...

I don't really recall if the TV950 has a 'setup' key, but if it does... (it's
been awhile, but I use tv955's and 905's alla time)...

While holding SHIFT down, press the setup key. If there is one, it's in the far upper right corner of the keyboard.
This'll getcha into setup MODE, which is the main point... if I recall correctly,
you'll now have lists of options at the bottom of the screen. You can use the 
up/down arrow keys to go to selections, and use the space bar to change 'em.
When yer done, use shift-setup again, then answer the question that appears
on the screen (as in "SAVE? Y/N" or some such).


I hope this helps... like I said, it's been a LONG time (years) since I've
messed with an old 950...

I have seen a couple of requests for this, so I'll post my response:
You can FTP the list from cajal.uoregon.edu. The file if in \pub, and
is called vt100.escape.codes. There is also a compressed version,
vt100.escape.codes.Z, if you have access to the Unix uncompress program.

	-Hope this helps!

    5.	Keys F1-F5 send no codes on the VT220 and VT320;  they are strictly

Look for a recent version of Kermit - version 3.11 has decent VT320
emulation.  Its user interface isn't as slick as some programs that 
are out there, and its file transfer isn't _quite_ as fast, but it's
one of the most solid VT emulators available & it works very well with
VMS, plus it's free.  It should be available on most bulletin boards;
you can also FTP it from Columbia (watsun.cc.columbia.edu in the kermit
directory) if you have access to FTP.

Good luck,

Bruce C. Wright

You don`t have to do it with the answerback. Send a sequence like:

clear screen
home
<commands you want executed>
printscreen_to_host

That will send up to 24 lines of commands back to the host system :-)

When DEC fixed that by preventing mail from passing <ESC> characters, they
forgot to prevent it from passing <DCS> so you could do something similar
with ReGIS macros. Eventually they 'fixed' that too :-(

Subject: Re: Vendors Needed

I work for one of the vendors (Digital) and check here every week
or so.  I've helped design Digital's low end video terminals since the
VT300 family, so am quite familiar with these products.

I try to answer questions that would be difficult to answer from other
sources.  I don't have time to help everyone who is looking for
information on VT100 escape sequences, and I'm not an expert on every VT
emulator, though I am working on making all of Digital's VT manuals
available on-line (as Postscript or PDF files).

What sort of vendor representation do you think would be most useful
in this forum.

Take a look at this posting from an AMR employee, archived on Google:

http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=9201170757.AA13539%40relay1.UU.NET&rnum=1

Unfortunately it appears that this device will not work standalone or
just hooked to a host but rather needs some extra network servers. At
least that's how I read this description.

Subject: Advance Micro Research "The Unterminal Station"

Hi,

I just received a machine which is called the "Advace Micro Research -
The Unterminal Station". I presume it is an X-terminal since it got a
SVGA-port on it.

I would like to get it up and running on Linux, but I get nothing (no
screen, no prompt, nothing).

This is the first time I get a graphical terminal into my hands.
Can anyone help me to get this device up and running with a Linux-server ?

Kind regards,

Gorik

I don't think this terminal can work the way you want, because the
UnTerminal stations must be connected to UnTerminal network cards in PCs;
at least that's how I read this posting from a former AMR employee:

SUBJECT:  DTR flow control for Ann Arbor?

Has anyone modified the ROMs in an Ann Arbor Ambassador to make the terminal
use DTR or CTS for hardware flow control, so I can disable XON/XOFF?  The Ann
Arbor support person claimed that they`ve never implemented it for my serial
number of terminal, so I`d like to hack it myself unless someone has already
solved the problem for me.

Hi,
        I've used an Ann Arbor for a few months and I believe that is 
conforms to the ansi standard as does the vt100. If you were to ask
Peter Langston at decvax!chico!esquire!psl, who at this time has several,
he could tell you specifically. I think that he may also have some
specialized software for it as well.

Subject: Ann Arbor Ambassador Set-up Y

:From lacasse@RAND-UNIX Tue Jun 15 17:24:54 1982

I think leaving set up mode with 'Y' puts the terminal in memory diagnostic
mode.  It can be awakened from this mode by hitting any key several times
(or holding CR, SPACE, etc.).  In this mode 1) the power is on (low and
high voltage), 2) the filiment on the CRT is on, 3) the video is off.  This
method of turn-off avoids the cool-down, warm-up cycle, but avoids burning
text or the cursor on the phosphor of the CRT.  This is probably optimal
from a maintenance point of view, at least for "off" times of under a day.
For that reason, we turn our Ambassadors "off" that way at Rand.

Subject: Function Key Program

Here is a program to load the function keys of an Ann Arbor Ambassador.
It is provided for those who have tired of translating DCS strings by hand.
This has been used on 4.1,4.1c,2.8,2.9 BSD systems and seems to be innocous.

Send any remarks to ucbvax!william or v:william@Berkeley.

or pre-ANSI.  I seem to recall using an aaa as a vt52 clone rather than vt100.

ESC 7 in VT terminals saves more than just the cursor position.
They also save the video attrbutes and the G0/G1/G2/G3 tables
and the GL/GR/SSGL states.

"ANSI" terminals such as SCOANSI, QANSI, AT386, ... only save
the cursor position.

Kermit 95 implements the above items correctly including the appropriate 
restore with ESC 8.

ESC 9 in a VT terminal is DEC Forward Index.  If you can tell me what
Change Graphics Rendition is supposed to do I should be able to implement
it for you.  If you have a complete terminal spec that would be 
even better.

I have an Ann Arbor Ambassador manual (January 1983).
For this item, it says:

zCGR CHANGE GRAPHIC RENDITION (ESC 9)

        Changes the graphic rendition of the character at the cursor, and all
        following characters in the active Qualified Area (see DAQ), to that
        specified by the present setting of the GR-register; see SGR.

Jeff,

Upon a little investigation in the Ann Arbor manual I believe that you
are correct in the that Esc 7 and 8 command also store/restore the
graphics setting.  No information in the manual about what specific
registers are used.

See the reply by Thomas Dickey for a definition of what the Ann Arbor
Esc 9 command does.  I don't have much more info then this definition to
explain what it does.  I could send you a copy of the Ann Arbor manual
that I have if this would help but it's pretty thin on implementation
details.

When you say that you could implement it for me do you mean that you
could modify an existing emulator of your own design or are you talking
about the Kermit 95 product?  This sounds fantastic!  We could take this
discussion to direct e-mail if you would like.

Subject: Terminal Woes

I have been having problems setting up, or even acquiring basic
information with a terminal, which I want to communicate with Linux.
Be aware that I have little experience with Linux and this would be
my first real "project" I would pursuing on the OS.

I purchased an old terminal from a second hand store a while back,
which I used as a telephone.  This is a Canadian made AlexTel dumb
terminal.  From researching the matter I found out the project ALEX
was a Canadian project by Bell, Nortel, and a company from Quebec
whose name escapes me.  It was meant as a telephone, which is mounted
beside the CRT and can input text via a fold able keyboard attached to
the bottom of the CRT.  It is meant as a terminal for the blind (TTY)
and a telephone.  In the back there is a DB-25 female printer port and
an RS232 male DB9 serial connector along with two phone jacks.  Serial
connection is easily established via a hot key and a black screen is
shown, this obviously produces an error without a working connection.


I have two problems essentially, I have no clue how to properly
connect this to my machine physically; and I have had bad luck
purchasing the wrong cables.  I first purchased a Male DB25 to Female
DB9 serial cable along with a Serial Extender.  To my dismay I did
this before I realized that communication is done through the DB9 on
the terminal and not the printer port.  I am considering purchasing a
block adapter to convert the DB25 to DB9 and connect this to the
serial connection on the terminal.  Would this be wise?  I also heard
that people can use a null modem cable, I have one of those does it
apply to this situation? How can I set this up?

My second, and more important problem is getting more information
about the model and which terminal standard it uses. I have found so
little information about this unit, I am worrying about properly
interfacing it.  There is no FCC ID to look up because it is Canadian
made, but the information is as follows:

CRTC ID :  332 2794 A. 
Nortel Serial Number: 140000688  
Nortel Model Number:  NT9G52AJ 
Nortel Product Number: NNTM000119.   

Nothing in the way of copyright date can be found, although I am
guessing this is really old, circa 1981, by the baud rate it uses.
The configuration screens do not reveal too much, only baud settings,
parity check, and the like. I scoured termcap extensively but could
not find a description even remotely associated with this
terminal. Other than that I can find no technical documents regarding
the terminal.

Any help you guys can provide regarding either, physical connection or
information would be greatly appreciated.

The ALEXtel terminal appears to be one designed for use with Bell Canada's
"videotex" service, introduced in 1991.  It probably understands only the
graphics-oriented NAPLPS (North American Presentation Level Protocol
Syntax) protocol, and perhaps only the alphageometrical subset of that. 

I suggest that trying to get an ALEXtel unit to communicate usefully with
Linux is going to be more difficult than you would like.  I suggest that
you look for a different terminal that emulates (or is) a DEC VT100 or a
successor model.  (Other viable types include TVI955, Wyse 50, or ADM-3a.)
...

A collection of ALEXtel terminals has been found useful for artistic endeavors:

I am not sure about the ALEX terminal but it sounds a bit like one Telstra
(then Telecom Australia) released in the mid 1980s.  It died a rapid and sad
death in the market place.  The one I worked on had little ROM "bubbles"
that clipped into the keyboard, and micro tapes to store data.

As I recall, there was an optional bubble to purchase a VT100 emulation and
communication protocol.  I did manage to get it respond via the modem
installed in the unit, but without the special ROM the machine brought no
joy.

Nope,  

Thanks to all that helped, however, it was surprisingly simple to get
the terminal running; despite the odd terminal, it works with all
character attributes fine, running termcap's "vt100" definition.

I used a null modem serial and changed the inittab and it worked.
(I was shocked.)

Subject: Free (but really old)

   Most likely used as historical pieces (doubt you'd get much use out of
them), the following two items are free to anyone interested.

  Bell ALEXtel.  Basically a small monitor (10"?) with keyboard and modem
built in.  Can be used for connecting to BBS's and freenets.  Also works as
a regular phone (fool your friends into thinking it's a video phone).

  Hewlett Packard 45711B portable computer.  Heavy.  Old.  Less hard drive
space than a floppy drive (speaking of which, no floppy drive).  Runs DOS
2.1.  Comes with power cord!  Woohoo!  Works great as paperweight.

I guess they could be conversation pieces if you have the room to display
them (which I don't).

Hi,
There are a lot of similar, and unanswered, questions on this ng.  I
can't track down any info elsewhere though, so here goes.

The unit is as supplied until quite recently by the bank of scotland
HOBS(home office banking system).  It seems to be very like a minitel
terminal, possibly exactly the same, and is made in france.  I have
found lists of escape seqs to control the screen, which even my french
can cope with!  However not all of them work, I have it talking to a
java program via an rs232 transeiver chip, and I have sent almost
every sequence I can think of.  In particular I cannot control the
cursor(on/off, movement).
Anyone have a clue here?

Thanks for any help you can give,
Alex

Well, I don't know what I was doing wrong before, I have that sorted.

Now what I would really like to know is a way of turning the local
echo off remotely.  It is turned off locally using the fnct key, this
transmits nothing.

Cheers,
Alex

Thanks, I had found a couple of these, sadly the french page is beyond
me.  I have another which is a little clearer, but most of the codes
don't seem to work.  It might be for different hardware.

What I most want to do is send it codes to turn off local echo, and
change the baud rate.  This has to be done by pressing key
combinations on the terminal.

I can put it in acsii mode remotely, where some VT100 codes work. 
Also, higher baud rates become available, but only in this mode.

I will be using this mode because it has 80 columns, and it will not do
80 cols in prestel/teletel mode.

Thanks for your help,
Alex

I addition to checking for modem/null modem by swapping data leads as others
suggest, are you SURE the terminal setup has not changed?

The Falco's I remember had an MMJ port as well as 25 pin, with a SETUP
switch to toggle between them.

I used to use these a while back. They did seem to often XOFF themselves
spontaneously on power up. Try giving it a CTRL/Q (xon).

hi !

I'm Thierry from France.
about the hardware, there was many different kind of hardware. the cpu 
used was 68XX with very few RAM with just *one* sound : pip ! :-)

I'm looking for a scheme and I'll tell you here what I found in a couple 
of days.

I don't remember for sure but ...

If you're right about the MC part then it will probably have been the
MC6802 this is a varient of the MC6800 (NOT MC68000) with 128 bytes of
memory onchip (32 bytes battery backupable) and running at 1Mhz.

There would have been an extra 1kbyte of memory for the display buffer
and the BT viewdata ASIC. The display was 40x25 designed for a TV just
like teletext.

The really upmarket versions would have had a real keyboard, most just
had a telephone style numberpad on which you entered ascii digits or
a sequence like:

  *1234#                Page numbers
  *90#                  Logout
  *910# to *990#        Various editing stuff.

The modem was a 1200/75 (75 bits per second upstream, 1200 downstream).

Looking at the character set in my old dusty hackers handbook, I don't
see the ^G defined as bell, so I'd say it couldn't even beep.

Wow!

Just the other day I was wondering whatever became of Minitel!

I saw it in 1986, when I imagine it was pretty popular.  However,
since everything was from a single source provider (the French PTT),
I seem to recall that participating in their communities was pretty
expensive.  So I never did much more than poke around the surface of
minitel.

Its been so long that I don't recall any specifics of how they
operate.  Are you trying to test it out in France? :-)  I'd say your
best bet on getting information about these is to find some French
computing forums and ask politely in the best French that you can
manage :-).

Subject: Solaris 10 Terminal Types

It seems that my new Solaris 10 sparc system doesn't get it when
setting the TERM to pt80-e. Don't ask me why the software developers at
my company use pt80-e, but they do on other Solaris 8 and 9 systems
without any problems.

On the Solaris 10 box, when I set the term equal to pt80-e, the session
does not regonize the "clear" command (nothing happens) and it will not
vi a file. Doing the same exact thing on my Solaris 8 system and
everything works. I'm kinda stuck here as the web provides nill on
pt80-e and Solaris 10 term types.

root #> vi log.txt
pt80-e: Unknown terminal type
I don't know what kind of terminal you are on - all I have is 'pt80-e'.

SunOS 5.8 sun4u SPARC:

	% export TERM=pt80-e
	% vi
	pt80-e: Unknown terminal type

Same on Solaris 8 x86, Solaris 9 SPARC, and even 2.5.1 SPARC.

Someone else installed the pt80-e terminfo on your Solaris 8/9 systems?

Sparse hints in Internet sources suggest that the "PT80" was a
character-cell video terminal made and sold by the German company
Siemens A.G.  I have never seen one (despite my having been employed
by a Siemens joint-venture enterprise during the 1980s), so I
conclude that PT80s have always been rare in North America.

Circumstantial evidence indicates that you work for Lawson Software,
which is apparently one of a handful of companies that still rely
on the PT80 terminal type.  We may guess that the sysadmins at
Lawson have a private "terminfo" entry for "pt80-e" which they
customarily install on new Solaris systems.  Perhaps the custom was
neglected in your case, but you'll have to find out within Lawson.

The situation with a terminal prefix of "PT" is a bit confusing,
because at least three hardware vendors have used it.  (This is in
addition to the software entity called "pty", the "pseudo-terminal".)

During its heyday, Prime Computer sold a series of terminals
comprising the PT100, PT200, and PT250.  Prime (PR1ME) was later
absorbed by ComputerVision of Framingham.

Back in the 1980s, when AT&T was trying to be a computer company,
it introduced a line of character-cell video terminals, an early
member of which was the Personal Terminal 505, or PT505 for short.
(This apparently was the same thing as a "Getset 5430".)  Some of
AT&T's terminal products were sold under the "Teletype" brandname.
Over time AT&T's product roster came to include all the following:

    ATT500 series (including ATT510, ATT513, etc.)
    ATT600 series
    ATT700 series
    ATT2300 series
    Teletype 4400 series
    Teletype 5400 series
    Teletype 5600 series (including ATT5620, etc.)

The AT&T terminal business eventually came into the ownership of
Boundless Technologies, which has collected many such lines of
business, and still (in A.D. 2006) sells new character-cell text
video terminals.

    http://www.boundless.com/text%20terminals.htm

For other information on character-cell terminals and how to use them,
you can have a look at my "Archive of Video Terminal Information":

Google suggests it's specific to an application that normally sets
LATERM (Lawson TERM).  The developers probably found it convenient
to have a single name for the terminal.

Sir Richard:

Sounds more like RS-485 to me.  Check out Chris Blum's essay:

    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/blum_serial_port.txt

You'd probably need a converter/adapter from Black Box Corp.

    http://www.blackbox.com/

I've never seen a  Westinghouse W1643, but if it was used for
airline reservations, it is probably not what you'd want as a
Linux terminal.

I have some info that might help a lil, I currently work for a major
airline and have used the systems that have run on them. We currently
use Worldspan aka "PARS" (Programmable Airline Reservation System) as
we call it at work. Each command must have a SOM (Start of Message)
which looks kinda like >

The funky symbols that you see are modifiers as an example to log on
would like this:

>BSIA(4 digit numeric number)(2 letter code)/(duty code) so would basically
look like this (>BSIA1234AB/GS) followed by enter

to add a name to the reservation aka PNR (Passenger Name Record) would be:

>-LAST/FIRST

Another airline I worked for also used the W1642 Termnial. So I can
input more if you would like, or email you. Some other stations still
use the W840 and the W1642 Terminals I can tell you more info if you
would like.
