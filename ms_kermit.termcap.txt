terminals and/or the MS-DOS Kermit or Macintosh Kermit VT320 emulators.	 These
termcaps were submitted by users, and none of them should be considered

Subject: Termcap entry for Kermit emulators (PC and Mac)

Well, you asked for it: here is my personal entry into the termcap fray: this
does just about everything that MacKermit 0.98 and MS-DOS Kermit 3.0 do that
UNIX machines care about.  Especially important to have (for any ANSI-style
terminal that can handle these) are the entries for UP, DO, LE, RI, IC, DC,
AL, and DL (which are the multiple item versions of move up, down, left, and
right; insert and delete character, and add and delete lines, respectively).
Many newer programs (notably Emacs, tcsh, and a few news readers) can use
these features to do much faster terminal updates.

The only parts that are questionable (they use Zenith-style escapes) are:

Everything else should be fully vt320 compatible, although you will want to
try it out just to be sure.  It should all work for MS-DOS Kermit 3.0 too...

We also might want to look at the features of Xterm, and (possibly) add any of
these that the Kermit emulators don't yet do...

Subject: termcap entry for a vt320 

Christine,

In Info-Kermit Digest V11 #4, you mention that people with vt320 termcap
entries should send them in.  I wasn't sure exactly which address to send
to, so hope you don't mind.  :-) I posted one to the USENET newsgroup
comp.terminals recently.  It's something I threw together, but should be
fine.  It's still being tested.	 But, I've had no problems so far.  I'll
include a copy of it here.  It's heavily documented (more than need be, but
so what?  :) ...

Does MS-KERMIT 3.0 return an ID when given an ID request?  You implied that
it might return something when sent an "ESC Z", which, FYI, a vt320 doesn't
respond to.  The appropriate ID request control sequence is "ESC [ c" (also
known as "CSI c").  The vt320 should respond with "^[[?63;1;2;67;8c", where
"^[" is ESCape.	 Just curious, that's all...

[Ed. - MS-DOS Kermit sends "ESC [ ? 63; 1; 2; 8; 9 c", since its capabilities
are slightly different from a VT320.  It responds this way to both "ESC Z" and
to "ESC [ c".]

I just ftp-ed the file `vt320emu.txt' from the test directory on watsun.  I
noticed some of the additions you added to the emulation that don't exist in a
real vt320, such as absolute cursor movement vertically (or horizontally)
only.  This would require a different termcap entry than the default for a
"real" vt320.  I'll look over the document a little more..I've only glanced
over it, at this point.	 I'll write up a new termcap entry, that will point to
the vt320 entry I sent you, with the appropriate additions/changes.  This may
take a little while, though, as I'm in the middle of some other projects.
But, then..who knows?  :)

If you have any questions or comments regarding this termcap, please send
me a note.  Thanks...  Enjoy!

# This vt320 termcap entry is a test entry for a vt320.	 (Imagine that? ;-)
# It was written from scratch.	All (well, at least, most :) of the
# capabilities have been commented and should be approximately in the order
# that they are in the entry.  I took some educated guesses at some of
# these, with info from the vt320 "Installing and Using .." manual and from
# some other termcap entries.  I have yet to test the status line stuff, I
# will probably test it soon, though.  Where I wasn't sure what to put for
# a capability, I added a comment of some sort.	 Also, the initialization
# string has comments about what each control sequence is supposed to do.
# If you have any comments or questions regarding this termcap entry, or if
# you see something I missed, please send me a note.  Thanks...

# p.s. Yeah, all these comments don't need to be included, but (who knows?)

terminal type to vt300 and then doing 'echo $TERMCAP'.	This is an old

Ultrix versions.

Subject: VT 320 Termcap

Dear Kermit people,

	I found that none of our Unix systems had a termcap entry to take
full advantage of the VT-320 terminal capabilities offered in MS Kermit 3.0,
so I wrote one.	 It is enclosed below.	I believe I have correctly
implimented everything that Kermit 3.0's terminal emulation has and that
termcap knows about, except in the special function keys (I found only F1-F4
pre-assigned a code).  If you find anything incorrect, or have additions,
please send them to me.	 I will pass on additions sent to me on.

Joe, 
Brian suggested you might be interested in what I did for his VT320 emulation
under Kermit.  Brian said it seems to work, but has not got an application to
test it thoroughly.  Basically, your VT320 terminfo was the same as one that
I had got off the net a few days before and had pretty much reverse translated
to a termcap entry.  Terminfo had more facilities than termcap so it was not
possible (at least with my limited experience) to translate some of the
parameterized terminfo strings to termcap.  The strings I simply could not
translate I finally omitted the key altogether (I think there were only two
or three entries).

I then copied the new termcap entry into /etc/termcap and compiled the original
terminfo entry into the terminfo data base.  We run SunOS 4.1.1 so applications
have a choice of using termcap or terminfo.

I found that when I attempted to specify vt320 to the login terminal type
prompt I got a complaint about the termcap entry being too large, moreover,
every session which subsequently logged out received a message about a termcap
entry being too large.  I then removed enough fields from the termcap entry
to get rid of the messages.  It was not a scientific removal, simply take from
the end being careful to preserve those things I thought might make a 
difference to kermit in deciding whether the host believed it to be truly a
vt320 (this was primarily the is= string).  I will include my full termcap
entry below, perhaps someone who knows more about termcap/terminfo can make
a better stab at fixing it up.

It probably means that applications using terminfo will work OK but those using
termcap will find some things do not work properly.

--  Original after reverse coding terminfo (note ts did not get translated and
    I don't believe that sa gave the same result when I ran captoinfo that was
    in the original terminfo.
