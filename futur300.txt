Congratulations! Your search for the best in Deaf telecommunications is over.
You can expect many years of pleasure and satisfaction calling TTY's or
computers. Futura FUTURA III version 3.00 software is here and offers many
features YOU suggested and many new original features you can't find anywhere
else.

This software works in 45.45 baud FUTURA to 300 baud ASCII with a PHONE-TTY CM-4
modem or a ULTRATEC Intele-modem, and any Hayes-compatible modem (in 300 baud
ASCII only and not FUTURA mode). Please note that very few portable TTY's in the
community have the ASCII option in the TTY's. This software will work with the
Macintosh if you have the Intele-modem  and a intermediate software called
"SoftPC" or "SoftAT" software by Insignia Solutions, Inc.

This software displays a instruction guide on the screen which makes it very
easy to use.  When used with the PHONE-TTY  CM-4 modem, or Ultratec Intele-
Modem, it allows your IBM compatible computer (an XT 8mhz 8088 up to a
Pentium) to communicate with a Telecommunication Device for the Deaf, and
another computer to access Deafnet, CompuServe, Gallaudet VAX and other
bulletin board services. The software requires a 270k minimum memory, one
serial port (COM1-4) and DOS or OS/2.

It is very user friendly. It is very easy to install. A comprehensive User
Guide book is supplied but not needed for beginners.

NEW FEATURES FOR 3.0:
 Jump into Futura from another program FAST (.2 seconds) when the
  telephone rings. TSR supported. Easy to setup. Uses only 7K RAM.
 Enhanced telephone directory search for specific name or phone
  number string for fast dialing by name or number. Also helps to
  identify phone numbers.
 Improved Caller ID Support-see caller's name and phone number from
  the source before answering!  Keeps a log. This requires the ANI-232
  Caller ID hardware and service with your local telephone company.
 You can interrupt an ASCII conversation with a flashing "May I
  interrupt,please?" flag.
 Identa Ring support with Phone-TTY CM-4 modem - available in some
  areas.
 Pager support - Alerts your remote pager of new messages in computer
  Auto-answer.
 Color/Wallpaper setup - larger dazzling selection of colors or
  wallpaper styles.
 Conversation style selection - pick one of the four different
  Send/Receive screen appearance.
 Send names and telephone numbers right from the telephone directory
  file while on-line.
 Improved Windows compatibility - PIF file allows you to run Futura
  in Window environment.
 Automatic hang up of the telephone call if Futura's keyboard is not
  used for fifteen minutes, and the conversation will be saved
  automatically.
 OS/2 compatible. Futura now works in OS/2 evironment.
 If left in Main Menu, Futura will turn on Auto-answer mode after
  designated number of rings.
 Enhanced automatic action of just-completed FUTURA conversation.  Setup
  option allows either erasing or saving of conversation text.  Can be
  manually overridden whenever needed on all calls.
 Touch tone dialing with Phone-TTY CM-4 modem using a secondary Hayes
  compatible modem.
 Prefix dialing allows telephone directory file to be portable.
 New and larger User's Guide book.

WHAT IS A TDD?  WHAT IS A TTY?

TDD is an abbreviation of Telephone Device for the Deaf which is a
communication device for the Deaf which may not be compatible with each other.
In the "beginning", in 1968, all TTYs for the deaf were TELETYPE compatible,
such as the model 12, 14, 15, 20, 28, 30, 31, 32, 42 which were manufactured
by TeleTYpe Corporation.  Communication products for the deaf that was not
made by TELETYPE Corporation was referred to as a TDD in 1969.  The first
American portable TDD, the SCANATYPE, was made by ESSCO Corporation of New
Jersey under contract with Lee Brody and dubbed a TDD by Betty Broecker of
Philadelphia.  Today, TELETYPE Corporation is no longer in operation.  Deaf
people communicate with others using the Baudot TELETYPE code, 5 bits, at
45.45 baud, since 1968.  As the result of a popularity vote, a TDD is now
called a FUTURA (TeleTYpe) to be used by everyone, deaf and hearing.  Hayes
compatible modems are NOT compatible with TTYs.  This is due to different
tones generated by the FUTURA modem which uses frequencies at 1400 Hz for mark
and 1800 Hz for space.  A Hayes compatible modem such as the Bell 103 modem
(300 baud ASCII) generate tones in originate mode at 1270 Hz for mark and 1070
Hz for space while in answer mode, it is 2225 Hz for mark and 2025 Hz for
space.  Most of the TTY/TDD on the market do not have the ASCII option.  So,
you can see why a FUTURA modem for FUTURA communication is required for full access
to the network.  

REQUIREMENTS:
  þ     Phone-TTY CM-4 Modem      (45.45 baud Baudot to 300 baud ASCII) or
        Ultratec Intele-Modem     (45.45 baud Baudot to 300 baud ASCII) or
        Krown SM85H               (45.45 baud Baudot only) or
        Hayes compatible modem    (300 baud ASCII only)
  þ     IBM XT (8 MHZ 8088 or better), AT, PS/2, 386, 486, up to the Pentium.
  þ     LCD/Monochrome (laptop computer), Color Graphics Adapter (CGA),
        Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), Multi-Color Graphics Array
        (MCGA), or Video Graphics Array (VGA).
  þ     Serial Port (COM 1 - 4).
  þ     270K minimum free RAM.
  þ     DOS version 2.0 or higher.

OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT:
  þ     ANI-232 Caller-ID modem

INSTALLATION:

Place this disk in drive A, type " A:  " or in drive B, then type " B:  "and
press <ENTER> key, then type "INSTALL" and press <ENTER>.  Follow the
instructions on the screen.  Do not use COPY commands to copy the files.  It
is not necessary to create batch file such as "FUTURA.BAT".

LETS GET STARTED:

Execute the program by typing "TTY" and press <ENTER> key at DOS prompt.  Your
best friend for learning how to use the program is to use <ALT + Z> in any
part of the program.  To press <ALT + Z> key, just press and hold the <ALT>
key while you press <Z> key.  The <ALT + Z> is a help screen related to
current functions.  In other words, not all help screens are the same for each
function.  After playing with every command outlined in all help screens, you
should be able to master this FUTURA program.  When modem selection is set to
"None", press <NUM LOCK> to simulate other user's typing.  This way you can
try out the Futura-TTY software without a modem.  With a Hayes compatible
modem, you can try a call to a relay service or a Bulletin Board Service (BBS)
in 300 baud ASCII.

To jump-start from DOS prompt into the position you would like Futura to be,
there are jump commands.  This will work only if "C:\FUTURA" has been
installed in path string command of AUTOEXEC.BAT file and if AUTOEXEC.BAT
contains the string "SET FUTURA=C:\FUTURA".  While your prompt on the screen
reads such as "C:\>", you may type:

  þ FUTURA -TSR                    To turn on swapping for quick answering.
  þ FUTURA -A                                  To ANSWER incoming call now.
  þ FUTURA -A< Fn >             To ANSWER with < Fn >key [n=1..12] message.
  þ FUTURA -D                                       To go to DIRECTORY now.
  þ FUTURA -M                                  To go to MESSAGE CENTER now.
  þ FUTURA -M< n >       To MESSAGE CENTER with < #n >key [n=1..3] message.
  þ FUTURA -Z                                       To go to MAIN MENU now.
  þ FUTURA -MONOVGA               To go to Mono-VGA screen color in laptop.
  þ FUTURA                                             To go to Futura now.

If you want to leave your computer in Auto-Answer mode for an extended period
of time and you want to be sure that in case of temporary power failure, that
Futura-TTY III is back in Auto-Answer mode when power is restored, you will
want to include the command "FUTURA -M" on the last line of AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

This program contains the FUTUR300.ZIP file which may be freely distributed to
anyone.  This FUTUR300.ZIP file is a DEMO version.  Feel free to upload this
file to any public Bulletin Board System (BBS) that will accept it.  To use
this file yourself, uncompress the file with PKUNZIP.EXE program.  If you need
assistance on this, contact your dealer.

FUTURA.PIF FILE FOR WINDOWS:

386/486 Computers with 2mb or more:  The hot key for the program is
<CTRL+ALT+F>.  Use it whenever you are in Windows 3.0 or 3.1, FUTURA in
Auto-Answer mode will run in background to take messages even if other program
is running.  This means you can operate another program and immediately switch
to FUTURA-TTY program to answer the phone call when your telephone signaler
flashes, then go back to where you left off.

286/8086 Computers:  There is no hot key directly, but can use the <ALT + TAB>
key to rotate programs.  FUTURA will not run in background due to CPU's
limitations.

DEMO VERSION OF FUTURA-TTY II:
 þ    5 minutes limit on FUTURA or 300 baud ASCII call, unlimited for 300 baud
      ASCII calls to a Futura-TTY dealer or user.
 þ    Accepts only 1 message taking feature.
 þ    Remote retrieval not supported. Demonstration of remote retrieval in
      Notes is supported. Directory is not supported.
 þ    This Readme file.

FULL VERSION OF FUTURA-TTY III:
 þ     Comes with updated guide book and updated Readme file.
 þ     Unlimited time on each call.
 þ     Unlimited message taking.
 þ     Remote retrieval is supported.
 þ     And many many more NEW features as you will learn from using it.

If you initiate a outgoing call with a PHONE-TTY CM-4 modem by dialing a
number, watch the monitor (MON) light to observe if the line is busy or
ringing and the carrier detect (C.D.) light.  If the C.D.  green light comes
on, that means you have detected a ASCII handshake and you can expect a 300
baud ASCII response on your screen.  If the C.D.  green light does NOT come on
and the MON light flickers as if there is a either voice or FUTURA response, then
tap the space bar.  If it is a FUTURA response, a tap on the space bar will cause
your program to default to FUTURA (45.45 baud Baudot) mode and you will then be
able to read the incoming message if it is also in 45.45 baud BAUDOT.

If you have a ULTRATEC INTELE-MODEM and you have dialed a number,watch the
monitor light (SIG) to note if line is busy or ringing.  If there is no ASCII
detection or handshake, the modem will default automatically to 45.45 baud
Baudot mode.  If you tap the space bar, it will default to 45.45 baud.

If you set up FUTURA with either PHONE-TTY CM-4 or the ULTRATEC INTELE-MODEM
to accept a call in Auto Answer mode in 300 baud ASCII mode and the incoming
call is at 45.45 baud BAUDOT, the program will automatically default to 45.45
baud Baudot mode after a short delay.

In the autoexec.bat file, be sure to set up the PATH string accurately which
should be exactly as the example "PATH=C:\DOS;C:\FUTURA" etc...  We noted that
a improper PATH string caused the telephone to answer improperly.  After you
have corrected the PATH string, do a "cold boot" (Turn off the computer, wait
ten seconds, then turn it on) in order to remove any "glitch" in the software.

                                     CALLER-ID MODEM

You should be aware that Caller-ID service has to be ordered from your
telephone company for which there is a small monthly charge.  Caller-ID
service is now available in more than 24 states.  You should check to see if
the service is available in your area before you purchase the Caller-ID modem.

How To Install:

The ANI-232 Caller-ID modem requires no battery.  It is as small as a gender
changer.  It has a DB25F (25 pin) port on one end and a RJ11 jack on the other
end.  The RJ11 jack is to be connected with modular cord to the same telephone
wall jack as the telephone modular cord from the PC/TTY modem using a "T"
adapter.  In other words, one phone line is shared with the FUTURA modem and the
Caller-ID modem.

The DB25F (25 pin) jack of the ANI-232 Caller-ID is to be connected to the
next available serial port in back of the computer (CPU) that is not used.
The selected Serial (COM) port must have a different IRQ Interrupt from the
COM port used by any of the modems, mouse or other devices, internal or
external.

If the selected Serial port in back of the computer has nine (9) pins, you may
have to use a gender changer adapter DB9M (9 pin male) to DB25F (25 pin
female) to be placed between the Caller-ID and the 9 pin Serial port.

Compatibility of serial ports:

All IBM compatible personal computers may use up to four serial Communications
(COM) ports - COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4.  The Caller-ID uses one of these
ports.  Other equipment, such as serial printers, serial mouse device, and TTY
modem use these ports.

Most computers are shipped with at least the first serial port COM1, already
equipped with a serial connector (9 pin male or 25 pin male) for attaching an
external device such as a serial mouse, a external modem, or a serial printer.

Most internal Hayes compatible modem cards are set at the factory in the
default position to use COM2.  Check the modem manual.  Some internal Hayes
compatible modems allow four COM ports to be used but allow only two COM ports
to be active at the same time with only two different IRQ interrupts.
Example:

                Serial PortIRQ         Serial Port Address (Hex)

                COM1       IRQ4        3F8
                COM2       IRQ3        2F8
                COM3       IRQ4        3E8
                COM4       IRQ3        2E8

Some Hayes compatible modems allow configuration for IRQ5 for COM3 and IRQ7
for COM4 by changing jumper positions on the modem card to allow up to four
COM ports to be active at the same time.  Example:

                Serial PortIRQ         Serial Port Address (Hex)

                COM1       IRQ4        3F8
                COM2       IRQ3        2F8
                COM3       IRQ5        3E8
                COM4       IRQ7        2E8

Check your choice of communication software to see if it allows for use of
IRQ5 and IRQ7.  FUTURA-TTY III, PRODIGY and PROCOMM PLUS does allow use of IRQ5
and IRQ7 interrupts.

Some communication programs such as PRODIGY in COM3 or COM4 will require users
to specify the Serial Port Address (Hex) in setting up the software.

All communications programs that use IRQs support those listed for COM1 and
COM2, and most communication programs support the positions listed for COM3 or
COM4.  However, don't use the same IRQ number for two devices that you plan to
operate at the same time, such as a Caller-ID modem at COM1 and a FUTURA modem at
COM3, and both using IRQ4.

You may want to check your computer to see if there are any conflicts of COM
ports.  One way is to purchase a software called CHECKIT from your local
software store.  This software will display which COM ports are in use and
whether the IRQ Interrupt is shared with another device.  You can share a
Serial port with a Mouse device if the MOUSE program is not active at the same
time.  How to recognize a Serial Port:

In back of the computer, the serial ports always have a MALE pin receptacle
which may be either nine (9) pin or twenty-five (25) pin RS232 or both.
(Exception:  Radio Shack computers have FEMALE receptacles marked as Serial
ports).  A 25 pin FEMALE receptacle in the back of the computer is for use of
a Parallel (Sometimes called a Centronics type) printer.  Some computers allow
installation of two parallel printers (LPT1 and LPT2) and both 25 pin FEMALE
connectors in the back of the computer look alike.  (Note that there are two
types of printers, either a serial or the more popular parallel printer.)

If you are using a FUTURA modem and a Caller-ID:

If you are using the external Serial port for your external FUTURA modem, you may
plug the Caller-ID modem into the second external Serial port.  If you dont
have a second Serial port, you will have to purchase a internal Serial Port
card to put inside your computer.  Your FUTURA modem would probably be configured
as COM 1 (IRQ 4) and your Caller-ID would be COM 2 (IRQ 3).

If you are using a FUTURA modem, a Hayes compatible modem, and a Caller-ID:

If you have only one external Serial port and it is already used by your
external FUTURA modem, and you already have a internal Hayes compatible modem
card inside your computer, that means COM 1 (IRQ4) for FUTURA modem and COM 2
(IRQ3) for internal Hayes modem has already been taken up.  To add the
Caller-ID modem to the next available serial port, it will be necessary to add
a internal Serial port card to occupy a slot inside your computer.  This
serial card may be limited to either COM 1 or COM 2.  In this case, your
internal Hayes compatible modem card must be changed for COM 3 (IRQ 5).
Remember no two serial devices may have the same IRQ number.

For your information, many brands of Hayes compatible modems do not have IRQ
interrupts other than IRQ3 and IRQ4.  Consult your dealer before purchasing
the Hayes compatible modem.

REVIEW:  How to use Remote Retrieval of messages left in AutoAnswer:

          1-While in the main menu, press <S> for Setup menu.
          2-While in the Setup window, press <R> for Remote Retrieval setup.
          3-Press <E> to enable remote retrieval (CURRENT:ON)
          4-Press <P> to change your password from PASSWORD to your choice.
          5-Press <ESC> to exit from the setup menu.
          6-Press <X> to exit to the main menu.
          7-Press <M> to message-taking position.

From another location using a FUTURA or another computer, call the Futura-TTY
program which is left in AutoAnswer mode and after you have read the outgoing
message, type "PASSWORD?" or whatever you have installed.  If you are using
Futura-TTY to retrieve your message, your password must be different from the
other Futura-TTY.  Your password will show for a few seconds and then erase
itself.  You will then type "NEW GA".  You will then read a short report of
whatever foldername is on the FIRST line of the reviewing menu regardless of
its foldername.  The first line should be reserved for AUTO-ANSWER folder.  It
will ask you "Read it now YqN?  GA" You will then type "YES GA".  If you want
to read the contents of a different folder, type "NEW foldername GA" or "OLD
foldername GA".  If you want a list of the foldernames, type "LIST GA".

In the Review menu, if the first line foldername is not "Auto Answer folder"
in the Review menu, press "1" to change the foldername, and type in the
correction.  Messages received and saved from Autoanswer mode is always stored
in the first foldername regardless of the name given to it.

If you want to look up a phone number of United Airline by remote control, you
will type "PHONE UNITED GA" after you have used your password.  To close the
Remote Retrieval file, you will type "SK".

To practice further, you should review the User's Guide on page 16-17 and
press <N> (Leave a note to a user window) to practice all the remote retrieval
commands without using a second phone line.

We want to thank the many FUTURA users who have written to us with suggestions
and comments so that we can bring to you this new version 3.0.  We will
continue to listen to your comments so that the next version of FUTURA and
this README file may include more of your suggestions.


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

QUESTION:  "My AutoAnswer is not working.  Why?"

ANSWER:    You may have
1) installed the wrong modem cable and the ring detector line is not
connected.  The modem cable must have support pins #1-8, 20 & 22 wired.  Ask
for a standard IBM compatible modem cable to fit your serial port, in the back
of your computer which may be either a 25 pin RS232 connector or a 9 pin D
connector.  If there are 25 wires in your serial modem cable, it is acceptable
as long as there are no crossover or jumped connections.  Some 25 pin cables
may not have all the internal wires connected or may be defective.

2) no message in the Message-taking setup file.  3) too many telephones and
telephone signalers on the same line.  Telephone service normally has a limit
of 5.0 REN which is equivalent to approximately 5 devices on the line.  Beyond
5 devices, the phone will not ring.

QUESTION:  "Will Futura-TTY work with the Macintosh computer ?"

ANSWER:  Yes, provided you use a software with it that allows the Mac to
operate in the "PC" environment.  This software is called SoftPC by Insignia
Solutions.

QUESTION:  "How can I install the new external modem when I have no available
serial port?"

ANSWER:  You may need to install a inexpensive serial card inside the computer
and set the COM port on the card so there will be no conflict.

QUESTION:  "Should I buy a Hayes compatible modem as a second modem?"

ANSWER:  Yes, but it will not be compatible with TTYS for the deaf.  You can
have different modems to co-exist in different ports.  Very few TTYS purchased
by the deaf community have the ASCII option in the FUTURA to accept 300 baud
ASCII.  We recommend a 2400 baud modem either internal or external for calling
Prodigy with Prodigy software, or other bulletin boards with Procomm Plus
software.  FUTURA-TTY software cannot be used at higher speed than 300 baud
ASCII and cannot be used to call Prodigy.  Modem manufacturers have
established compatibility standards so that all Hayes compatible modems at
2400 baud ASCII are compatible with each other.  Hayes compatible modems from
different manufacturers at 9600 baud ASCII are compatible in "most" cases but
not in all cases.  At higher speed than 9600 baud, to be compatible in most
cases, it may be necessary to use a modem from the same manufacturer at both
ends, the host and the caller.  This will change in the near future.

QUESTION:  "I have a old IBM compatible computer that is a 4.77 MHZ 8088
system and it does not work well with FUTURA-TTY.  Why?

ANSWER:  FUTURA-TTY software cannot dial properly with a slow
4.77 MHZ 8088 system.  The computer must be at least a 8 MHZ 8088 or better.

QUESTION:  "I use FUTURA-TTY software with a business phone but I cannot dial
out.  Why?

ANSWER:  Some digital business telephones are restricted to digital tone
dialer and does not accept pulse dialing.  Be sure you have your telephone
company install a dedicated analog line for both pulse and tone dialer with a
RJ11 jack which is installed "before" the KSU box.  To transfer a FUTURA call in
Baudot or ASCII mode from one phone to a second phone, the first phone must be
disconnected as soon as the second phone is answered.  The ASCII carrier can
be maintained only between two phones, not three.  CM-4 modem is a pulse
dialer and the Intel-modem is a tone dialer.  Residential telephone service
will accept either a pulse or tone dialer modem.  The new version 3.0 of
FUTURA-TTY to be announced soon will allow the CM-4 modem to dial very fast in
tone-i dialer mode by incorporating the internal Hayes modem as a dialer.

QUESTION:  "I called home from my work to retrieve messages in AutoAnswer and
found that it does not work.  Why?

ANSWER:  If your "PASSWORD" in FUTURA software at work is the same "PASSWORD"
in FUTURA software at home, it will not work.  The "PASSWORD" must be
different for each location.

For technical assistance, contact the dealer from whom you purchased
FUTURA-TTY.
