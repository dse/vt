On 30 August 1995, Boundless Technologies bought DEC's terminals business.

    http://www.boundless.com/news/pr83095.htm

The VT510, VT520, and VT525 are still being offered, as well as Dorio models.

As of March A.D. 1995, the currently marketed products of Digital
Equipment Corporation were:

    VT510 single-session terminal
    VT520  multi-session terminal
    VT525     color text terminal

Advertised features include ANSI controls, PCTerm support, emulation
of 18 major terminal types; support for 25 languages and character sets.

From the 48-state United States, call 800/354-9000 for information.
From elsewhere, contact the local DEC sales organiztion.

   [1996 UPDATE:  DEC has sold its terminals business to Boundless Systems.
    The above URLs are stale.  However, 
    Boundless can still sell you a new VT520 if you want.

    1998 UPDATE: DEC is being bought out by Compaq.  Character-cell
    terminals have never been important to Compaq.

    2002 UPDATE: Compaq has been acquired by Hewlett-Packard.  Although
    HP has sold character-cell terminals, this seems no longer to be
    an important line of business.

2002 Update:

Several of the news articles archived in this file contain the following
hostname in their distribution path: "nntpd.lkg.dec.com".  This would have
been an NNTP news server machine located at the Digital King Street campus
in Littleton, Massachusetts, at the intersection of I-495 and Rt. 119, where
the mighty DEC network-technology operation was centered during the late
1980s--where once thousands labored over implementing the OSI protocol suite,
which was believed to be destined to quickly surpass TCP/IP in popularity.
Times have changed.  As of August A.D. 2002, the buildings bear signs that
say "HP: Invent", and OSI has faded.

2008 Update:

The times just keep on a'changin. Hewlett-Packard, as part of its global
shrinkage strategy, sold the King Street campus off.  The buildings are
now being renovated for use by IBM!

Joe Doupnik did something like this in MS-Kermit.  You can set his program
to either VT100 or VT102, but the operational behavior is essentially
identical.  The two settings differ only in how the emulation responds to
a terminal-type query sequence from the host.

(MS-Kermit also can emulate VT220, VT320 and several other types.)

Since the introduction of the first ANSI-compatible DEC terminal, the
VT100, Digital Equipment Corporation has been pretty good about making
each new generation of video terminal products capable of a superset of
the operations that the previous generation could do.  Thus the VT100
could operate in either its ANSI style or that of the older, cruder VT52
product.

The VT102 did what the VT100 did plus a few tricks.  The VT125 did what
the VT102 could do plus ReGIS graphics.  (There were some other VT1xx
models about which I know little.)

Later, the VT220, VT240, and VT241 (there was no VT200 as such) added a
good many capabilities (such as the 8-bit multinational character set),
but there was a setup option to make it seem to be a VT100.  (The VT240
and the VT241 differed only in whether a monochrome or color monitor was
supplied.)

One major change from the VT100 series was the keyboard layout, with the
LK201 keyboard in the VT200 series adding numerous top-row special-
function keys while omitting the single-purpose Escape key and a couple
others.  The LK201 also introduced the Compose Character key, which to
this day remains shrouded in mystery. ;-)

Some of the LK201 function keys sent codes to the host, while others had
only local effect.  When you put the VT220 into VT100 mode, three of the
top-row function keys reverted to VT100 purposes, such as Escape,
Linefeed, and Backspace.  And the LK201 put the <> characters in the
controversial B00 position, to the left of the Z.  (This tendency was not
just DEC's; at about the same time, IBM put \| in the B00 position on the
keyboard of the original IBM PC.  International standards often have the
effect of making all nationalities equally disgruntled.)

The VT300 series (VT320, VT330, and VT340) added some features and, to
some extent, compensated for aspects of the VT200 series that users had
complained about.  Then there came the VT400 series, and the now-current
VT500 series.

There are various new features that have been introduced at each step,
but if a host computer sends out a valid series of VT100 display codes,
a listening VT510 will correctly format its screen display in just the 
same way the VT100 would.

I suggest you connect by "anonymous FTP" to CS.UTK.EDU (if your machine
is registered in the DNS); look in "pub/shuford/terminal" and retrieve
the file "vt510_function_checklist.ps", a PostScript file that contains
a good list of terminal features with some information on which terminals
support them.

   [available from the DEC page at
    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html ]

But really, if you think your emulation is going to be used by any large
number of people, you would do them a favor by also obtaining and reading
the real documentation of the terminals you are trying to emulate.  (It
wouldn't hurt, either, to try out a real terminal of the intended type.)

One cost-effective document is "VT220 Programmer Pocket Guide", part
number EK-VT220-HR-001, $21.00 (US). From the 48-state United States,
call 1-800/DIGITAL to order this. From elsewhere, dial +1 603/884-6660.

Alas, the "VT510 Reference Manual" (EK-VT510-RM) will cost $220.00!

(P.S. the Compose Character key is used to generate characters from the
Multinational Character Set.)

Ah - the LK201 of fond memory! There was a UK variant of this, which was
a nightmare for C programmers. I can't remember the details, but many
of the interesting punctuations {}[]| were quite inaccessible. After
using one I insisted that we order the US layout.

The Compose Character key then became a great boon. <Compose><L><-> for
the UK pound sign - as a sort of nationalistic protest I changed my
VMS prompt from $ to that.

The "compose" variations were quite well thought out in a vaguely

Well, once I finally found the box with my null modem cables in it (in
the process of moving, can't find anything) I hooked the terminal to my
Linux box, and changed lilo.conf to tell the computer that the terminal
was the system console. Fired up the terminal, worked perfectly. I was
really worried about the backspace not working in local mode. I thought
the terminal was responsible for all of that. Oh well, it works, and I
appreciate the help. Now I know more about how the VT220 works.

I also found that the VT220 has a composite output jack on the back!
I got a little adapter at Radio Shack that went from the BNC to an RCA
jack. I then hooked it to a T.V., and it worked pretty well, although
the TV has lower resolution than the VT220. Just for fun, I plan to
connect this thing to the big screen T.V. once it's out of storage. Now
I can play 43" NetHack :).

While I am on the subject of the VT220, I have noticed that when listing
long directories, cat-ing readme files, or running certain programs, the
text display gets messed up, and I get superfluous characters, text out
of alignment and the like. Could this be caused by the termcap entry?
Could it be that Slackware linux doesn't have the proper entry for a
VT100? (I run it in VT100 mode, I may start using it in VT220 mode, but
I was always told that VT100 mode was more compatible) Or could it be
caused by the baudrate? I have both the computer and the terminal set up
to talk at 19200 baud, and my serial cable isn't very long, so I don't
really think it's a problem, but I can't be sure. Thanks!

It is highly *unlikely* to be caused by the termcap/terminfo entry.
This is probably a symptom of serial flow control not working between the
Linux box and the terminal.

Most DEC terminals prefer to use inband Xon/Xoff (Control-S/Control-Q)
flow control.  This may be configured by "stty".

You should read David S. Lawyer's HOWTO documents on serial lines and
video terminals from The Linux Documentation Project:

What would you like to know?

It's a multisession terminal, it uses a standard PS/2 keyboard, and it's
backward compatable with VT420/320/220/102/100, etc. It'll talk to a Linux
box quite happily.

It's got one standard DTE 25-pin serial port, a couple of MMJ serial 
ports, and a standard Parallel port. So you can avoid using odd connectors
if you want to, as long as you're happy running just the one session.

Give me a shout if you've got any other questions!

The 'Compose' key is for creating high-order ascii characters, and other
ascii characters not on the keyboard. To use it, you must operate the
terminal in an eight-bit environment, and be using the VT in VT220 mode.
Put simply, you compose an accented character by a two or three character
sequence, e.g. for A-umlaut you would type COMPOSE A ", for c-cedilla type
COMPOSE c , ... for GB pound sign it's COMPOSE l =, for Japanese yen it's
COMPOSE Y =. Most of the accented characters are fairly easy to guess once
you understand the principle of 'combining' the ascii characters.

The contents of the function keys are host-writable, but the VT220 loses the
settings when turned off. You could look at the ANSWERBACK field though.

>Are there

The character matrix on the VT220 is a bit too crude to allow much in the
way of Japanese, as the chinese root symbols that most of Japanese starts
words with are too complex to the represented properly. Terminals such as
the VT320 have more complex character matrices.

The VT220 is a text-only terminal. A quick guide as to the main differences
between the VT terminals follows:

Terminal	Extended Mono	Colour	Redefinable  Refresh Dual Host
		keybd?	 Graph? Graph?  characters?  rate    (2 sessions)?

VT1200		Yes	 Yes	(Monochrome X-windows terminal)		**
VT1300		Yes   	 No	Yes (Colour X-windows terminal)		**

All VT100-400 terminals are ANSI X3.41-1977 and X.3.64-1979 compliant.
VTx30 and x40 terminals use Regis graphics, which can provide bitmapped
displays. The VT340 display is very similar to EGA. Terminals marked
with ** are current digital terminals.  (as of 1991!)

(As of 1998, the VT520 %% is certainly current, but the others may not be.)

DEC settled on an official definition of "VT100 compatibility" some years
back.  (For the curious, it exists as an internal-only document perhaps an
inch thick that defines a model for a terminal and then the actions in all
circumstances.  The definitions are given in simple Pascal - which is actually
executable.  If executed, it gives you a slow implementation of a VT100--
slow because the point is clarity and ease of understanding, not execution
speed or program size.)  All DEC terminals that claim "VT100 compatibility"
are tested against this spec, and must conform to it.  As far as I know, all
of them do.

The actual spec for the "VT100" does not actually match the original VT100
terminal.  Rather, the standard is really almost identical to the VT102, a
later version.  For the most part, the VT102 was the same as the VT100 with
the AVO option (which gave you 24 lines in 132 character mode, rather than 12;
and all four character special renditions - bold, blink, underline, reverse -
rather than just one, which was either reverse or underline, depending on how
you set the cursor display) and, I think, the printer controller and modem
interfaces.

The only significant features of the VT100 that I know of that were left out
of the VT102 (and all subsequent terminals) were the user-controllable LED's
on the keyboard and control of interlace mode.  (The VT100 could run its
display in either interlaced or non-interlaced mode.  The choice could be made
in SETUP or with an escape sequence.  The original VT100 had 4 LED's on the
keyboard, all under user control.  Some versions of the VT100 series reserved
some of the LED's for other indicators, mainly the state of modem lines; on
these I think two user-controllable LED's remained.  Later terminals dropped
these LED's entirely.)

Also, the VT102 omitted all the known VT100 "bugs", some of which had come to
be seen as interesting "features" (for example, the "ring the bell forever"
mode).

By the way, the following things are not considered part of the VT100 speci-
fication:

	- SETUP mode
	- On-screen appearance of characters.  The fonts used are not
		specified, nor how the different character renditions are
		to be implemented (except that they are all to be visibly
		distinct, in all combinations).  In particular, "bold" was
		implemented on the original VT100 series using greater beam
		intensity.  The color VT240 used a different color.  All
		recent terminals use an alternative font with more pixels
		turned on.
	- The configuration of the keyboard, beyond the requirement that there
		be some way to enter the entire 7-bit ASCII set.  (The spec
		may not bother to say this explicitly.)

The major feature of the VT100 that people noticed being omitted from
the VT220 was the Escape key.

(Well, sort of.  If you put the VT320 or VT220 into VT100 mode, you
can use the F11 key of the keyboard as an Escape key, but then you
can't use the new terminal's extra features.  On the VT320, and I
think also on the VT220, you can transmit an Escape character by
pressing the key combination Control-3.  You can also type
Control-[, which is pretty much the definition of the Escape code.)

In intention, anyway, the electronic features of new DEC terminals
have generally been a superset of what the older products could do.

Yes, some features were dropped, such as the direct LED control
sequences and the serial port control commands for changing bit rates
and parity.

(In a previous life I designed terminal firmware ... it was always
exciting trying to determine *which* "standard vt100" folks wanted.
That's the nice thing about standards -- there are always so many from
which to choose!)

No; you can change neither feature.  The VT101 was a "cost-reduced" version of
the VT100 WITHOUT AVO.  AVO mainly provided extra memory - fairly expensive
in those days - which supported both the extra 10 lines in 132-column mode,
and the additional character renditions.  The VT102 was the corresponding
"cost-reduced" VT100 WITH AVO.

No upgrade existed from the VT101 to the VT102 - the terminal was "cost-
reduced" by making it a bounded, unmodifiable configuration.  (In practice,
I'm sure you could unsolder the memory chip and ROM's in a VT101 and replace
them with VT102 memory and ROM's.  In fact, it's quite possible that ONLY
the memory chips differed.  So, a sufficiently motivated hardware hacker
could probably get the job done.  But given the price of VT102's these days,
is it really worth the trouble?)

|

This particular failure mode is unfamiliar to me, which just means that it
wasn't very common on VT100's less than, say, 5 years old.  Be aware that the
repair philosophy of all DEC terminals is based on unit replaced of one of a
very few FRU's (Field Replaceable Unit).  There are something like 5 FRU's
in a VT100.  (A friend's VT100 was damaged during a move:  The handle on the
power switch broke.  Repair:  Replace the containing FRU, which was the
power supply module.)  Repair of the FRU's, if done at all, was at factory
facilities.  That is:  You are on your own; there will be no published
information at this level of repair detail.

Yes, that's perfectly normal for a VT10x without the AVO installed.
The AVO provides additional memory that (a) extends that to 24 lines
and (b) gives every character several independent attributes.

"Burned out capacitor??"  I'm not sure what that is but from the sound of
things you were lucky you didn't electrocute yourself.  The monitor is
either an Elkston or a Ball standard video monitor assembly, and should
be simple for any qualified CRT technician to diagnose and repair or,
more cheaply actually, replace.  Don't mess around with these yourself
as the high voltage can kill you.

There is a VT1xx series technical (shop) manual; I have one but am not
willing to part with it.  You might consider chucking the whole thing
and using a cheap IBM PC clone with VT1xx emulator software instead,.

vt102 with "block mode". Block mode lets you transmit a while block at
a time rather than a character at a time, and use a built in editor
(in the terminal) to do editing locally. This is for IBM mainframes
and similar computers with a block-I/O mentality. The 131-ness is due
to a chip which fits on the motherboard. If you remove the chip, you
get a vt102 (it shows so in the setup screen).

Important note: A vt102 is functionally similar (but not functionally
identical) to a vt100. It is however hardware-wise radically
different.

>VT220		Nice text terminal; has bitmap graphics

The vt220 has no bitmapped graphics. It supports DEC sixels, which are
good for defining a user-downloadable character set, but that's not
the same as real graphics.

>VT240		Nice graphics terminal

Graphics: ReGIS, Tektronix.

Generally the vt220, vt320, vt420 are one series ... The 320 has a
very nice menu set up. vt240, vt340 are one series too. I've never
heard of a vt440 ...

My goodness.  I can't believe that you left out the vt-05 terminal. 
	72x20 screen, weird looking long heavy fiberglass case.

There was also the DEC-GIGI which I can't remember;
ReGis graphics and all.

Please, people... surely SOMEONE remembers ??
 
The DEC GIGI terminal was quite similar to the VT-640.  The 640 supported
native GIGI mode, ReGIS mode (it was a mode peculiar to the 640, though), and
Sixel graphics.  Note, that GIGI and ReGIS as we know it today are not quite
identical.
Perhaps we should move this to comp.sys.dec  ? :-)

Was there a DEC VT-640?  The only VT-640 I know of was Digital Engineering's
(NOT DEC's!) "RetroGraphics" add-on for DEC's VT100, which provided overlaid
Tektronix 401x graphics emulation (and nothing else) on top of the VT100 text
video.

The nicest DEC "terminal" I ever used was their VS60 stroke-refresh work
station (VR48 video, VT48 display processor as a second Unibus master).
It was essentially upward compatible with the "VT11" (which went under
several guises).  TECO on one of those blew away all other text editors.

I use the ~ key as ESC, the </> key as ~/`, and shift-, and shift-. for < and
>.  This is easy to do with the DECterm keyboard customizations options, and
is quite natural for those of us who were learned to type on computers before
the larger international keyboards were introduced.

The one problem is that other windowing programs don't necessarily pick up
those resources, so you may need to go into the resource files and set them
manually; even so, there are probably some X applications that just ignore
those resources.  I don't let keyboard differences fluster me, even though I
touch type, but I'm the exception, not the rule.  If your users are just using
DECterm, they shouldn't have any problems with this setup.

I think you're right, but there is too much (good) software that needs
an ESC-Key ... ;-)

Or press Ctrl-3. (Ctrl-8 sends Delete, both Combinations are not very 
well known)

Works, as in VT52 mode. (F12 sends Backspace in both modes)

There are a few possibilitis:

1) Set your terminal to VT52/100 Emulation mode. Then your ESC/BS/LF keys
   work but the other F-keys are dead.

2) Type Ctrl-3. That works always. If you have an american keyboard,
   Ctrl-[ works also.

3) I don't know, if it works for the vt220, but the vt320 and vt420
   can be programmed (Setup Keyboard) that the american ~` key sends ESC.
   This works only, if you have an american keyboard installed (bug
   or feature ?).

4) You can programm any Function key in conjunction with Shift as user-defined.
   If you want to use Shift-F11 as ESC-Key in VT220/320/420-Terminal mode
   then let your host send "DCS 1;1|23/1B;24/08;25/0A ST" where DCS=ESC P
   and ST=ESC \  in 7bit mode. This puts BS and LF on F12/13 as well.
   On most compatible vt-terms the string "DCS 1;1|43/1B;44/08;45/0A ST"
   works for the unshifted F-Keys but not on DECs :-( . 
   I put a similar sequence in my login script.

The 15pin monitor cable connector pinouts are:

	1	Blue return
	2	Green return
	3	Red return
	4	Mono return
	5,6	Ground
	7,8	+12VDC
	9	Blue video
	10	Green video
	11	Red video
	12	Mono video
	13	Monitor present
	14	Keyboard receive
	15	Keyboard transmit

Signals are straight video.  VR201 monitor gets its power through the +12VDC
line (pins 7&8), VR241 has its own power supply.  I'm not sure where the
sync comes from in the colour signals (green?), but it's there in the mono
signal.

This pinout is pretty much the same for all DEC monitor cables.

That onfo came from Field Circus.  I wanted to (and did) hook up a VR201
to a GIGI.  

The pinout is standard from DECmates to workstations; however note that 
mono only systems don't use the colour lines and vice-versa.  There's 
only one "monitor present" line (tied to ground in the monitor, or in the 
connector block for those monitors that use BNC connectors), so a machine 
can't tell if there's a VR201 or a VR241 at the other end.  (Actually, if 
the thing at the other end draws power, it's a 201, since the 241 has its 
own power supply, but I don't believe that's implemented anywhere.)

Thus, you can (in theory at least, ie assuming the cable brings does the
right thing with all the lines) use a VR201 with the same cable on a
VT240, DECmate or Rainbow; likewise with the VR241.  The cable is not so
much a "DECmate" (or whatever) cable as a "VR201" (or VR241) cable. 
The VR201 cable is the same pinout at both ends -- you can bang two of
them together if you need a longer cable to the monitor/keyboard.  (I
think it brings the colour lines out as well (which the VR201 ignores),
but I'm not sure.) 

From your commemts below, it sounds like while the VR201 cable is pretty 
much standard across the board, the 241 cables have some bogosities in 
their implementations.

>My experience with the DM II (as opposed to the III and III+) is that the

That will be because the VR241 doesn't listen to the mono line, and the 
mono socket of the DECmate doesn't put anything on the colour lines.  Try 
re-wiring the mono line from DECmate to the green (I think -- whichever 
one generates the sync) line of the monitor.

Nothing changes on a VT240 whether there's a mono or colour screen on it;
it doesn't detect the 241.  Tha name "VT241" is ordering information
only; what you got when you ordered a VT241 was a box with "VT240" on the
front and a VR241 on top of it.  The 240 base unit generates both colour
and mono output, regardless of what's on the other end of the cable, and 
the ID sequence is identical.

Maybe they were lazy with that cable -- left out the "monitor present"

The 241 won't work at all in the mono socket.  Don't know why it won't 
behave in the gpx socket -- time to break out a meter and look!

And some are. Reminds me of my favorite Bill Hancock story. He was manning 
the help desk one day, and the phone rang :

Bill : "Hello, Help Desk"
User : (Gruffly) "Cursor's broke!"
Bill : "Beg your pardon?"
User : "Cursor's broke on my VT220 computer"
Bill : "Um, a VT220 is a terminal, not a computer, it's..."
User : "It *SAYS* VT220 right on the front!"
Bill : "OK, whatever. What's the problem?"
User : "There's no cursor on the screen"
Bill : "Are you sure it's plugged in?"
User : "Of course I'm sure. What do you think I am, some kind of idiot?"
Bill : (Using all the restraint he can muster) No, of course not. OK, here's
       what I want you to do. Sometimes the polarity gets reversed on those
       VT220 computers. So, I want you to unplug it from the outlet, turn
       the plug around, and plug it back in" (knowing full well that it's a
       grounded plug and can only be plugged in one way, of course)
User : "OK, let me put the phone down". (Klunk. Step, step, step, step as
       he walks across the room. Silence. Then a faraway-sounding, whiny
       "b-e-e-e-e-p". Step, step, step, step). "OK, polarity reversed and
       the VT220 computer's working fine now!


Technical content follows :

Use SET TERMINAL/SYSPASSWORD/PERM. If a system password has not
previously been set, use SET PASSWORD/SYSTEM to set it. Note that this
does not really answer the question as asked, which was to prevent *all*
users from accessing the terminal. If *no one* is to be able to access it,
then the solution is to remove the power supply.

Think of the scrolling region as a subwindow.  It's always the full width of
the screen (though that restriction was eventually removed in the VT400
series of terminals), but it's otherwise very much a subwindow.  Once you've
set a scrolling region, most (not all) actions you can take are limited to
that subwindow.  You scroll the region just as you would scroll the entire
screen:  By inserting or deleting lines.

If you leave Cursor Relative mode set (as it is by default), cursor addressing
is relative to the scrolling region.  Many screen-oriented programs that are
intelligent enough to deal with different-sized windows will run happily
within the scrolling region, never knowing the difference.  (The limitation is
that sequences that affect the entire display, such as Erase in Display, will
not respect the scrolling region's boundaries.)

  Hello Erez

  I am currently writing this from home using my modem+pc and MS-Kermit and
am connected to our VAX/VMS machine: it works like a charm and I have the 
complete use of the keypad.  There is a separate utility that allows you
to use the NumLock (PC) as PF1 (VT) instead of the F1 (PC).

  Actually, I just checked, there are two such utilities: GOLD.ZIP and 
NM100.ARC.  I am using GOLD at present.

>I can get a vt220 terminal . Is there a way I could connect it to the pc and
>work directly on the vt220 ? 

  Yes, though I would not recommend it: I have both a VT220 and a VT320
and I prefer using the 14" screen of the 320 or of the PC, rather than
going down to 9" on the 220.

  All you need to do this is an external modem -hopefully, a recent Hayes
compatible one- and a parallel printer cable.  Use the default setup
on the VT except for the speed that will have to be adjusted to match this of
the modem.

  Happy hacking

alex

The VT100 scrolling region feature is peculiar, but it is very useful
in implementing "open-line" and "kill-line" functions on a real VT100,
which does not otherwise have such functions.  The way it works is that
one places the cursor in the desired region, establishes the scrolling
region via the escape sequence, and then further received data is
constrained to that scrolling region instead of the whole screen, while
data already on the screen outside the scrolling region stays fixed.
Thus, if you generate output into the scrolling region that would cause
whole-screen scrolling under normal circumstances (e.g. line-feed at
bottom of the region), the text within the scrolling region will scroll.
Data that scrolls "off" the region is discarded, and lines that scroll
"onto" the region start out empty.

Not all so-called "VT100 emulators" properly emulate this, nor indeed
several other, features of a genuine VT100.  Almost no emulator provides
smooth scrolling, which on a real VT100 is pretty nifty (assuming one's
host is properly honoring DC3/DC1 flow control from the terminal).

The problem is that the VT180 is NOT a terminal. It is a CP/M microcomputer,
with an integrated VT100-like terminal. The error message is coming from
the CPU which wants you to insert a CP/M boot disk. I used one about 10
years ago, but don't remember any way for you to use it merely as a terminal
(although there may well be one). I used it with Kermit when I wanted it to
behave as a terminal.

Probably not.  The DEC "GPX" video standard uses timing that's different from
anything generated by any PC (or Mac) video that I've heard of.  Also, 
DEC monitors want composite sync on green, which isn't common in the PC or
Mac world.  

It's of course possible that there is a PC video adapter out there which
would work but in the several months that I've been saying "probably not"
to this question, nobody has mentioned one. 

(Did a truckload of old DEC workstation monitors just hit the surplus market
or something?  This is the third time this has been asked lately, in about as
many weeks!)

I'm pretty new to emacs.  Most of you probably immediately recognize
ESC ~ as the command to set the buffer to "not-modified".  So, there's
an obvious conflict here.

What I would like to do is to change "not-modified" to ESC ~ ~ (or
something similar) and then define all my ESC ~ [ x keys to be equivalent
with the ESC [ x ~ keys.

Can somebody tell me how to do this?

With a real VT100, this is done by repainting the entire screen.  Period.

Later DEC terminals, including I think the VT102 (which really defines "VT100"
and has for years) - but certainly the VT200's - have the ability to insert
spaces on a line, shoving the rest of the line over.  As I recall, you can
only insert at the left, with extra characters at the right vanishing.  So
you can insert the necessary spaces, then paint the new leftmost characters.
This can only be done one line at a time, and probably isn't worth it in most
cases.

You have to go all the way to the VT400 series to get the ability to really
scroll a region of the screen horizontally.

It definitely won't work.  The VR241 (color monitor) runs on NTSC-like timing,
60 Hz V, 15750 Hz Hor., 525 scan lines.  The VAXstation I used a 1024x864
display (that lets you out right there, wildly wrong number of scan lines, 
525 vs. 864), 60 Hz V., 54 kHz horizontal.  Forget it. 

The pinout on that DB15 connector maybe wildly different too.

Yep.  A VT50 is a subset (feature wise) of a VT52.  The 50 or 52 can be
emulated.   The VT100s had VT5x mode for emulating them.  Maybe Kermit's VT100
mode or VT52 mode will fill the bill.  Procomm Plus has such modes, I believe.

The VT5x family included the VT50 and VT52 (there might have been a VT51 as
well).  I'm trying to remember, but this was about 15 years ago when I used
one and they were old THEN.  After all, the VT100 family came out in 1977 or
1978.  Anyway, the VT50 only had UPPERCASE and 12 lines per screen.  No, I'm
not kidding.

Subject: Re: looking for:  DEC VT05 Terminal

Direct addressing is one of the features listed in the
PDP-8 Small Computer Handbook, an extract of which is at

    http://vt100.net/vt05.html

Until last week, I hadn't found any corroboration of this, but I now
have a copy of the VT05 Alphanumeric Display Terminal Reference Manual,
which I will put online soon.

--quote--
3.8 Direct Cursor Addressing (CAD)
Through the use of CAD (016 octal), the cursor can be directed to any
one of the 1440 character locations on the CRT screen using three
instructions. The CAD function is used to allow updating of displayed
data without retransmitting the complete page. For example, if the
cursor is located in character location 55 of line 18 and the operator
wishes to update information beginning at character location 35 of line
9, transmission time would be greater if the operator used the cursor
control characters, e.g., "cursor up" and "cursor left" to move to the
new location. By using the CAD function and the codes shown in Table
3-3, the cursor can be quickly directed to any of the 1440 character
locations on the screen. A reduction in generation time is especially
noticeable when CAD-generated data is retrieved from memory.

CAD is received by the VT05, and the next two data words are interpreted
as the Y- and X-address. The Y-data word presets the Y-address counter
to the selected character line, and the X-data word presets the
X-address counter to the selected character position in the selected
line. Once the cursor is moved to the new location (or address), the
cycle is complete and the next data word received will perform its
normal function.

There is no termcap entry for a 'vt05', but there could be many reasons
for that. I have no idea how many people shelled out the $2795 list
price for a VT05 rather than sticking with their teletypes. Bill Joy
used an ADM-3a to develop vi and what would eventually become termcap.

Check copyrights first, but if you have access to a ReGIS VT terminal such

to download the little bit of screen that it's on, giving you some sort of
SIXEL like bit map.

define your own with similar appearance.  I may have read that you

It runs at 1024x864, 60 Hz vertical, 54 kHz hor.  It should work with the
typical VAXstation II (QVSS or GPX graphics) and with the on-board bitonal
frame buffer or GPX options on VAXstation 3100's.  

(Also, on a 3100 with either the GPX or the SPX card, this monitor can be used

VT100 GPO is Graphics Processor Option. You may send 'ESC[0c' to the terminal.
The terminal should reply with
  ESC[?1;0c meaning   Base VT100, no options       (VT101)
  ESC[?1;1c           Processor option (STP)
  ESC[?1;2c           Advanced video option (AVO)  (VT102)

  ESC[?1;6c           GPO and AVO
  ESC[?1;7c           GPO, STP, and AVO
  
A 1983 DEC product catalogue says, "Graphics capabilities (standard on the
VT125), can also be added to a VT100.
[...]
The VT125 [...] is an intelligent, microprocessor based alphanumeric video
terminal with data plotting extensions. The VT125 directly executes DIGITAL's
general purpose graphics descriptor, ReGIS (Remote Graphics Instruction Set)."

Well, I am not sure whether a VT100 with GPO can execute ReGIS...

Hope this is of some help,

Elizabeth,

: I have  an AT&T  610 (not the 630 the 610)
: it returns a sequence of ^[[?7;4;1c 
: Now it's at least Vt100 AVO compatible But what is
: STP and GPO?  I think it
: has these also. SO could someone tell me what STP and GPO are AND
: give  me the sequences for using these features.  THANKS.

Ahh, this is the original posting then.  Now if it had had VT100 in the
subject field, I would have read it.  As for an AT&T 610 terminal,
my assumption was, well, what's that.  Not interested.  Sorry.

According to my docu, the format of primary da report is ...

                { send report CSI ? Psc ; Ps1; ... Psn c
                                  ^     ^

                                  |     +------- Ps1; ... Psn = extensions
                                  |
                                  +------------- Psc = operating level
                Psc
                  indicates the terminal's architectural class code.  The
                  value of Psc depends on the terminal's current operating
                  level, as follows:

                  Psc         Terminal
                  7           vt131

                Ps1; ... Psn
                  indicates which of the following extensions the terminal
                  supports:

                  Ps          Meaning
                  1           132 columns
                  3           ReGIS graphics
                  4           Sixel graphics



Maybe you have Sixel graphics, but not ReGIS, since this is not a real
VT100 with GPO.

A brief description of Sixel follows...

Notes first.  7 bit version of DCS may be sent as ESC P
              (ie. Escape followed by a uppercase P).
              7 bit version of ST may be sent as ESC \

Notation for character codes is xx/yy, consider this column/row
from the Digital Code Tables. 

For example, ESC        is 1/11  (or hex 1B, or decimal 1*16 + 11)


Format is:

        DCS ps1 ; ps2 ; pn3 q s...s ST

where :
        ps1 is a macro parameter that selects the horizontal grid
          size and pixel aspect ration.

        ps2 selects how pixels specified as 0 are drawn.

        pn3 selects the horizontal grid size.

        s...s is the sixel picture data.  This includes printable
          characters and sixel control codes.

        Sixel printable characters
        --------------------------

          Characters in the range 3/15 - 7/14 are interpreted as sixel 
          printable characters.  The device subtracts the offset 
          hexadecimal 3F from the code, and assigns each of the 
          remaining 6 low-order bits to a grid position.  The six pixels
          are arranged vertically, as follows:

                  Top pixel           Bit 0 (LSB)
                                      Bit 1
                                      Bit 2
                                      Bit 3
                                      Bit 4
                  Bottom pixel        Bit 5 (MSB)

        Sixel control codes
        -------------------

          The following characters are interpreted as sixel control codes:

                  Code       Addreviation   Name
                  ------------------------------------------------------
                  !          DECGRI         Graphics Repeat Introducer
                                            (follow by number of times
                                             to repeat in ASCII decimal)
                  $          DECGCR         Graphics Carriage Return
                  -          DECGNL         Graphics New Line

                  0-9                       Parameter Characters
                  ;                         Parameter Separator



Now for a REAL example...

    ESC P q G j ^ j G ESC \

note that there are *not* spaces in the real code, and ESC is the
escape character.

: PS AT&T denies they even sold it!   SO manuals are right out.
                                      ^
                                      |
                                      +----  Ahh, this isn't emphasized,
                                             it's ether your finger still
                                             on shift, or a habit !!! :-)


Anyway, that's another attempt to be helpful, if any use.

Something's missing there -- that's not a complete, legal ANSI escape
sequence.

ANSI uses several character ranges during CSI and DCS sequence parsing.
The ranges 20-2F, 3A and 3C-3F are used for application-specific flags.
30-39 are the parameter values.  3B is the parameter separator.  The
final character -- sometimes called the sequence terminator -- must be
in the range 40-7E.

Perhaps the writer of your terminfo file meant to use the VT220-specific
(non-ANSI) code sequence "<ESC> >" (1B 3E).  This resets the numeric
keypad to numeric mode.  ("<ESC> =", 1B 3D sets application keypad
mode.)

It does work. The documentation leaves out one important detail--the font used
to display the page doesn't change. So, if you end up with a 132-column page,
you will only see 80-columns at a time. Use Control-[<-] or Control-[->] to
pan the screen back and forth and you will see the additional columns.

You neglected two really neat characteristics, at least in the KDF11-B board

I thought that we had wised up by the time of the RQDX3 and used something
else. Also, you overlooked the most stellar use of the T11, the VT240/1.
As I understood the design (I may be all wrong, I never had the stomach to
actually verify this), the 240 had an 8085 which did the processing of ascii
data, and a T11 which processed graphics, running the same code we used in
P/OS in some sort of software-reuse-gone-awry scheme. The fact that the 8085
had to hand each character to the T11 and get it back with a "nope, not for
me" handshake may have in some small way contributed to the performance of
the device.

Subject: RE: VT420/server multi-session handshake esc seq ?


	Can someone please tell me the escape sequences used by a VT420 and
	SSU or a terminal terminal to perform the multi-session handshaking?

They are not "escape sequences," a term with a specific meaning defined in
ANSI X.34 (I think that's the number).  The commands use an entirely different
format with a different introducer character; they exist at a different level
in the protocol stack.  (The protocol involved is called TDSMP, for Terminal
Device Session Management Protocol.  TDSMP commands can actually appear in
the middle of an escape sequence; when the session is resumed, parsing of the
escape sequence takes up where it left off.)

	I suspect they are documented in the VT420 programming reference
	manual, but I would like to avoid the expense and lead time of
	ordering it for this "simple" need.

	[EK-VT420-RM is list $C 173]

Don't bother ordering it for this purpose; the TDSMP commands are not
documented.

	I am trying to tailor a PC communications package to permit it to use
	a TCP/IP DECserver connection with ANSI emulation to one host, and
	VTxxx emulation to another host.

Be aware that TDSMP is protected by patents.  (Yes, not just in the US; in
Canada and much of the rest of the world, too.)  While it's true that a number
of third parties appear to have reverse-engineered the protocol and are
selling products based on it without public challenge from DEC, that doesn't
mean DEC won't change its mind - it's got a history of aggressively defending
its intellectual property rights.

  From the marketing literature...

  The short story is, that "Dorio" is a new "brand name" (marketing
  speak) for this terminal.  The VT510 and the Dorio were announced in
  Sept '93. The VT510 is for traditional Digital customers and the Dorio
  is for the "ASCII" terminal world.  There are some h/w and s/w
  differences between VT510 and Dorio, but they are very similar
  products. 

  The Dorio is:

   - Built by Digital Equipment Corp.
   - A new "brand name" (marketing speak)
   - It is an "ANSI/ASCII" terminal.
       ie. it has traditional Digital ANSI standard terminal modes

The VT420 is a dual session terminal.  The 320 is single session.

The VT420 has a local copy/paste within a session or between sessions.
It supports rectangular area operations via escape sequences.
It has 6 pages of memory.  
Horizontal scrolling within a rectangular area.
24, 36 or 48 lines of text on the screen at once. (This can be used with
horizontal split screen dual sessions, displaying 24 lines/session at once).

Some more random new escape sequences.

I wrote the spec for the VT420.  Let me know if you have more questions.

Subject: RE: Problem changing VT420 ID sequence


	I have a VT420 that I use to connect to a system that offers menu
	displays for VT100 and compatible terminals.

Well, no.  A VT420 *is* VT100-compatible.  Any program that queries the
terminal itself and then doesn't know enough to handle a VT420 properly is
simply wrong.

I thought we'd retired code like this 10 or 15 year ago.  This used to be a
major pain in the neck - code would run on a VT100 but not a VT102 because
the VT102's id sequence was (just a bit) different.

	    If I go into the Set-Up
	menus on the VT420 and select the General Set-Up screen, I can change
	the Terminal Mode from "VT420 mumble" to "VT100".  This can also be
	done via software but does not satisfy the requirements of the
	software offering me menu displays because it still tells me that the
	terminal is NOT VT100 compatible.  Back into the Set-Up menus (same
	screen), down towards the bottom of the screen is an item that says
	"VT420 ID" - this needs to be changed to "VT100 ID" - which I can do
	via the Set-Up but would really like to do this via a program...

	So, after all that - how do I (or can I) change this "VT420 ID" to
	"VT100 ID" via software?  I have RTFM but - no luck...

I don't believe you can.  I don't have any VT420 documentation here, but this
was not a software-settable parameter on earlier terminals.  (If you think
about it, just how much sense does it make for software to set it?  The
software would first have to know that it was talking to something that was
not a VT100, then tell it to lie.  Yes, I know, *some* of the software would
know, and it would ask the terminal to lie to *other*, broken software.
Sigh.  You really should complain loudly to your vendor about this; getting
it right isn't hard, and after all these years there's really no excuse.)

I gather many terminal settings that have traditionally not been software-
settable have been made so in the VT510.  It's possible this is among them.

Pressing the "Hold" key on a VT320 or VT510 inhibits the terminal
firmware from processing characters in the communication buffer.
If the host continues to transmit data while Hold Screen is enabled,
eventually the comm buffer fills, which triggers the XOFF character.
Pressing Control+S will cause the terminal to transmit a Control-S
(XOFF/DC3) character.

The VT510 has a local Define Key editor which allows you to program
a key to transmit Control-S.  Example, Enter Set-Up, go to the
Define Key Editor in the Keyboard menu, enter the editor. Press the
key you wish to assign Ctl-S to, define it as a User Defined Key (UDK).
Press Ctl-S at the UDK line prompt.  Arrow down and Save it if you
wish to have it defined this way upon Power Up.

As Patric Davies points out in his reply, getting the terminal to
transmit Control-S is only half the problem.  You must also configure
the host to pass Control-S on to the application.  This means that
you cannot use XOFF/XON software flow control.

I have seen this problem when people have hardware tab settings that
disagree with what they told Emacs in tab-width.  Emacs (and vi also) need
to know the tab stop settings so they can display properly.  You must have
uniform hardware tab-stops.  Not that you can use tab-stop-list if you want
to make Emacs text-entry appear to have non-uniform tab-stops in modes that
bind the TAB key to tab-to-tab-stop.

Not until the VT510 terminal is host control over the shape of the cursor

I'm not sure whether or not this is the only difference, but the VT102
has the capability of doing line and character inserts and deletes,
functions which are missing from the VT100.

In order to mimic line inserts or deletes on a VT100, it is necessary to
define a scrolling region from the line of interest to the bottom of the
display, and then scroll that region either up or down, depending upon
whether you want to delete the line of interest or else push down that
line (and all those below it) in order to insert a new blank line.  I
have no such clever work around for the absence of the character
insert/delete (but, then, I've never looked for one).

By the way, in my experience it seems that most terminal programs which
claim to be VT100 (not VT102) emulators also perform the line/character
insert/delete functions. So you aren't the only one who is unclear on
the difference between the two VT models.

The VT320 has a built-in monochrome display (white, green, or amber
phosphor).  The VT241, VT340, and recently announced VT525 support color
displays.

The VT525 works with low cost off-the-shelf PC monitors (SVGA), and
supports both ANSI and text attribute color.  MSRP is $649 with 14"
color monitor.  17" and 19" color monitors are also available.

On the VT100, the only escape sequence available is the one which turns off
all attributes (i.e. ESC[0m).

The VT220 introduced a new set of escape sequences to turn off individual 
attributes as follows:
ESC[22m   Bold off
ESC[24m   Underline off
ESC[25m   Blinking off
ESC[27m   Reverse Video off
These are available on vt220 and upwardly-compatible terminals. A vt100 
emulator should ignore these sequences.

Briefly, the VT100 is 7-bits only (US ASCII).  No 8-bit multinational
character sets, no top row function keys, does not have a separate
editing keypad with inverted T cursor keys.

The VT320 supports 8-bit Multinational characters (ISO Latin-1);
provides 105 key keyboard similar to Enhanced PC (separate top row
function keys, editing and numeric keypads); provides a 25th status line;
Terminal State Interrogation (host can read back almost all terminal
settings); soft character sets; and programmable top row function keys.

Physically the VT320 is much smaller, offers a higher resolution
display, and runs faster.

I think that you are referring to the VT300-mode request/response pair
DECRQM and DECRPM.

In the Digital documentation "VT330/VT340 Programmer Reference Manual,
Volume 1: Text Programming" (EK-VT3XX-TP-001) on page 238 we find

    MODE SETTINGS (VT300 mode only)

    Request Mode          DECRQM      CSI Pa $ p
                                      Pa = ANSI mode (see table 12-2)

                                      CSI ? Pd $ p
                                      Pa =  DEC private mode (see table 12-3)

    Report Mode           DECRPM      CSI Pa;Ps $ y
                                      Pa = ANSI mode (see table 12-2)

                                      Ps = mode state
                                       0 = unknown mode
                                       1 = set
                                       2 = reset
                                       3 = permanently set
                                       4 = permanently reset


    Set Mode              SM          CSI Pa; ...Pa h
                                      Pa = ANSI mode(s)

                                      CSI ? Pd; ...Pd h
                                      Pd =  DEC private mode(s)

    Reset Mode            RM          CSI Pa; ...Pa l
                                      Pa = ANSI mode(s)

                                      CSI ? Pd; ...Pd l
                                      Pd =  DEC private mode(s)


(Notes:  the CSI is hexadecimal 9B in 8-bit communication, or
         the sequence <Escape> [   in 7-bit communication.

         Pa, Ps, and Pd are variable parameters.

         The "l" in the above RM command is a lowercase "L".

         Spaces in the description are for clarity and are not transmitted.)

So one form of the response is appropriate for ANSI/ISO standardized
modes, and the other form for DEC proprietary modes.

Are you saying that MS-Kermit is generating the ANSI/ISO-mode response
to the DEC-mode query?

Kari is correct. A question mark was omitted from the DEC-specific report.

I've corrected that (and in msvibm.vt) here this morning and the results
will appear in the next beta of MS-Kermit.

This is very dependent on which exact VT terminal you're talking about.
For the VT300 series, there is no way to incorporate the status line
as part of the main screen, although some implementations (eg, DECterm,
a VT320-level implementation on DEC workstations) allow you to select
the status line or not, and also allow you to set the size of the main
screen (up to perhaps 72x132 or so being reasonable if you have a
1280x1024 screen), which gives you much the same capability that's being
asked for here.  However if the host software requests a status line, the
DECterm will helpfully create it for you (keeping your main window the
same size but possibly making the entire window too big to quite fit on
the screen if you've made it big).

The VT420, on the other hand, actually does allow you to combine the
status line with the main screen, so that you get true 25x80 screen
addressing but no status line.  It also allows you to set the terminal
in 36 or 48-line modes, but I think those include a separate status
line.  I don't know offhand what the VT420 does with the "Select Status
Line" commands if it's in 25x80 mode;  the terminal I've usually
experimented with for such questions is on the other side of town, and
the documentation around here is vague on the subject.

The subject of compatibility with VT-series status lines is rather
subtle.  I have yet to see any terminal emulator, commercial or
otherwise (including Kermit and even DEC's Pathworks terminal
emulator, I might add) that quite gets it all right.

Subject: Re: My vt320 termcap file

Regarding the F5 key:

Somebody else may point this out, but on a real DEC VT220 or VT320,
the first five top-row function keys are intended primarily as local
functions, not as things a remote application program can sense;
indeed F1 through F4 don't send anything to the host at all.

On a VT420 (for which I've got the manual here)

    KEY     FUNCTION
    ---     ------------------------------------------------------------
    F1      Hold (controls scrolling via XON/XOFF).

    F2      Local Print (prints screen to locally attached printer).
              Shift-F2 (on VT320) prints graphics and text.
            Control-F2 toggles auto-print mode.

    F3      Enter terminal's setup mode.

    F4      Switch sessions (for dual-session terminals).
            Control-F4 splits screen (for dual-session terminals).

    F5      Break (sends long serial break).
            Shift-F5 drops DTR to disconnect a modem.
            Control-F5 sends the terminal's answerback message to the
            remote host.

However, the more recent VT420 product can be configured (by use of
the setup menus) to have the F1 through F5 keys really send a code
sequence to the host instead of performing the local operation.  The
code sequences are of the form

     Esc [ 1 2 ~

in 7-bit communication environments or

     CSI   1 2 ~

in 8-bit communication environments.

    KEY     7-BIT CODE
    ---     -----------
    F1      Esc [ 1 1 ~
    F2      Esc [ 1 2 ~
    F3      Esc [ 1 3 ~
    F4      Esc [ 1 4 ~
    F5      Esc [ 1 5 ~

However, if you configure the VT420's first five function keys this
way, you lose the capability to perform their local functions, one of
which (F3) is to allow you to use the setup menus!  To recover from
this condition, you have to log out, turn off the terminal, wait 10
seconds, turn on the terminal, and then make F3 the very first key you
press after it has initialized.  Then the terminal enters setup mode,
and you can change the use of F3 (or other parameters).

Just for completeness, the keypad function keys emit

    KEY     8-BIT CODE
    ---     -----------
    PF1     SS3 P
    PF2     SS3 Q
    PF3     SS3 R
    PF4     SS3 S


    KEY     7-BIT CODE
    ---     -----------
    PF1     Esc O P
    PF2     Esc O Q
    PF3     Esc O R
    PF4     Esc O S

Subject: Re: Digital VT510 and hardware flow control

The VT510 offers DSR/DTR hardware flow control on either the
25-pin (male/female) Dsub or 6-pin MMJ connector.

Since the VT510 hardware was designed, many high speed modems
have adopted CTS/RTS flow control.  This makes sense for modems.
It is less obvious for terminals that need to work in existing
environments.

Most high speed modems use the Hayes AT command set and no
longer require DSR/DTR control signals for connection management.
Thus you can often wire the DSR/DTR signals from the terminal
to the CTS/RTS pins of the modem to take advantage of hardware
flow control.

Future VTs may include a CTS/RTS selection depending customer
interest and cost trade-offs.

Those should be CSI, not ESC.

Or use ESC [ for CSI.


These two commands are available on VT320-series and up.  The VT100 and
VT220 terminals don't have them.

I seem to recall the query commands being added with the VT320, not the

From the KERMIT.UPD for version 3.14:

SET TERMINAL COLOR 20
  If Kermit receives a "reset visual attributes" escape sequence (CSI 0 m)
  from the host, this does not affect the screen coloration.  However, some
  applications expect it to restore the default fore- and background colors.
  SET TERMINAL COLOR 20 tells Kermit to do this.  v3.14.

By the way, if you have any official DEC documentation that says this should
be the default behavior, we'd like to see it.  Our DEC VT manuals list the
actions to be taken on CSI 0 m very explicitly, and none of them affect the
coloration.

The VT220 command ESC SP F (called S7C1T in the DEC documentation) tells
the terminal to transmit the 7 bit equivalents for the 8 bit C1 codes to
the host, both for command responses (like the response to CSI c), and
for function keys which return C1 codes.

Likewise, ESC SP G (S8C1T) tells the terminal to transmit 8 bit C1 codes
if the terminal has an 8 bit data path to the host.  (The command has no
effect if the host port is set to 7 bit mode.)

These commands do not affect the interpretation of received codes.  To
do this, you'll have to set the terminal into 7 bit / mark parity mode.

I prefer to follow up, just in case others are wondering about this,

Subject: Re: Pathworks VT320 vs VT100


...whereas MY experience with "VT100" emulators suggests that many, maybe
even most, lack some fundamental capability: the ability to respond to an
auto-identification query, the ability to perform certain screen or cursor
operations, the ability to transmit appropriate "editing keypad" escape
sequences, etc.  The more layers (in this case Pathworks, plus whatever
transport(s) it is using to reach the VMS system) between the emulator and
the application, the more likely it is that some layer will intercept an
otherwise "vanilla" keycode and use it for its own purposes, or conversely
will insert its own background data into the stream without bothering to
inform the user.

   (My experience includes VAX and AXP VMS DECwindows/Motif "DECterm," SGI 
Irix "console" and "Unix shell," Macintosh MacTerminal and Red Ryder, numerous 
MS-DOS and MS-Windows terminal emulators including Qmodem, Procomm, MS-Kermit 
and others, and several Amiga- and (cringe) Atari-800-based emulators.  Of 
these, DECterm is definitive, MacTerminal, MS-Kermit, and "Kermit-65" on the 
Atari, are the only sufficiently complete emulations to receive my stamp of 
approval, and pretty much everything else I've seen is pure crap.)

  Beware.

The vt220 does not have a backtab facility, that's why it's not in
terminfo; shift-tab simply products a tab character. I just pick an
otherwise unused control key sequence and define that as backtab.

No.  But VT320's and above do have a 25th status line.  On VT420's and
above, the 25th line can be used as either a status line (logically a
separate display window) or as part of the main display window.   The
VT420 can also be configured with more lines, for example, a 36-line mode,
but the more dense displays get rather unreadable because the monitor
itself is still the same size as the other low-end VT monitors.

> b) If (a) == "Yes" then does that line scroll up with the rest of them if the

On the VT420's and above, if you have selected the 25th line to be part
of the main display, then it will scroll with the other 24 lines on the
display.  If you have selected the 25th line to be a status line, then
it will not scroll with the other 24 lines on the display.

The normal behavior for the DEC VT-class terminals if a cursor sequence tries
to place the cursor on any line beyond the end of the main display window
(that is, on the 25th line or below in most cases) is to place the cursor
at the same column position on the last line of the window (the 24th line
in most cases).  As I understand Kermit's behavior, it isn't strictly
compatible with the DEC hardware;  but there are other terminals out there
that do behave similarly to Kermit.

I wouldn't be surprised if the problem is that some of the software is
doing a terminal type query and setting itself up according to what it
receives from that - there's a fair amount of software in the DEC world
that does that (even though you're theoretically supposed to take the
OS's word for the terminal type).

Good luck,

Bruce C. Wright

	The "Un-terminal" is marketed by Advanced Micro Research,
San Jose, CA (408-456-9430).  UnTerminal product literature describes it
as a system box into which is plugged a VGA monitor, PC keyboard and mouse.

The system box connected to a driver card in the PC using a serial wire.
It appears that the driver card mimics a set of VGA registers and
communicates with the "terminal" system box using a proprietary protocol.
Compressed bitmap data is sent to the to update the display.  Drivers
available for SCO XENIX, UNIX, Open Desk Top, SunSoft-Interactive,
UNIXWARE, IGC-VM/386, Microbase-VirtuOS, TSL-PCMOS.

	The Digital VT525 or Dorio25 color text terminal also uses a
system box design (aka "pizza box").  It accepts an SVGA color monitor
and a PC keyboard.  It communicates with the host using standard RS232.
It has standard ANSI/ASCII text terminal emulations.
ANSI emulations:  VT525, VT420, VT320, VT220, VT100, PCTerm
ASCII emulations: WYSE 325, 160/60, PCTerm, 50/50+, 120/150

	We now have EZ-SetUp cartridges for VT500 terminals.  SetUp data
is stored in a plug-in cartridge so that it can be copied to other VT500
family terminals, reducing effort to manage groups of VT500 terminals.

You are viewing an "International" model VT420 which is equipped with both
a 25-pin  RS232 "D" connector and a DEC MMJ connector.  The "North American"
model VT420 has 2 DEC MMJ connectors only.  It also has an attached power
cord as there is no need for country specific power cords.

The VT220 and VT320 are similar except the VT320 includes

1) ISO Latin-1 and a User Preference Supplemental Set (in addition
    to DEC MCS).
2) 25th status line.
3) Terminal State Interrogation - the host can read back anything
    it can set.
These three features define "Level 3" or VT300 compatibility.

The VT320 also displays more scan lines (300 versus 240) and lacks
a video output jack.

The VT330 is a very different design that includes ReGIS, SIXELS,
and TEK 4010/4014 graphics, a mouse port, dual sessions, horizontal
or vertical split screen, and a bunch of other stuff.

The VT330 displays 500 scan lines (800x500 resolution).

	WARNING! I'm entering commercial mode:

	The VTLAN40 is our latest generation text terminal. It's a hybrid
	device that we just announced (and are getting alot of attention
	for). 

	We've created a full color windowing text terminal that can do 
	traditional serial line, multisession serial, TCP/IP (Telnet), 
	LAT and DECNET.  

	The windowing interface is a burned-in customized subset of Microsoft 
	Windows.

	The unit does DEC terminals up to VT420 (including VT340 with REGIS,
	SIXEL and Tektronix graphics) in 8 fully independent sessions.

	Available as a box only (use your own pc keyboard, mouse, monitor) 
	or complete with a choice of 14" up to 21" monitor.

	Suggested price for the box only is $890 for the system box an ranges
	up from their depending on monitor size. A base configured model with
	14" monitor is listed at about $1249.

	Feel free to send questions... or better yet, if you have a web browser
	point it at:

		http://www.digital.com/home.html

		Then use SEARCH to find the full press release on VTLAN40.

Incorrect.  Scrolling regions were in the original VT100.

The VT102 was one of the "second generation" of VT100-class terminals.  In
terms of the VT100, the VT102 included AVO (which gave you the four standard
video attributes as well as the full 24 rows in 132 column mode; the VT101
was the second-generation family member *without* AVO).  All the "second
generation" terminals were "bounded":  They couldn't be upgraded in any
way.  (The original VT100's could accept some options, and had room and power
in the box for some fairly complicated stuff - the VT103 was a VT100 with an
LSI-11/23 on a Q-18 bus, really an early PC.)

If I remember right - it's been years - the VT102 added the Insert Line and
Delete Line commands to the VT100 set.  On a VT100, you could, indeed,
simulate these using scrolling regions.

In practice, it's almost impossible to find any terminals or emulators that
do a "real VT100" - they all do a VT102.  In fact, the official *definition*
within DEC of "VT100 mode" is really "VT102 mode" - that's what you get in
a VT200 or later DEC terminal when it's in VT100 mode.  (I suspect the only
reason IL/DL weren't in the original VT100 is last-minute lack of code space -
something had to go, and these could be emulated easily with scrolling
regions.)

This is just a stab in the dark, but perhaps what Paul Taylor is referring
to when he speaks of the VT220's "foreground and background processing"
and "pop up windows" capabilities is actually the multiple session and
windows capabilities of the DEC VT420 terminal.  The VT420 allows one to
run two sessions at the same time, to toggle between them with the F4
(Session) key, and even to cut and paste text between sessions (windows). 
To do this, the terminal must be connected to the host or terminal server
using two cables, or to a terminal server that supports multiple sessions,
or to a host running Digital Equipment Corporation's Session Support
Utility (SSU).  If you absolutely, positively can't have a personal
computer and a terminal emulator (Kermit!) on your desktop, then a VT420
is the model terminal you beg for. 

What Mr. Taylor should know is that, whereas the VT420 allows only two
simultaneous sessions, Kermit supports six simultaneous TCP/IP
connections, even to the same host.  (At least MS-DOS Kermit 3.14 does.  I
don't know about the OS/2 version.)  One can easily toggle between these
multiple sessions by pressing Alt-n (\KnextSession).  (Again, I only
_know_ this is true for MS-DOS Kermit 3.14.  Check the documentation for 
your flavor of Kermit.)

What _is_ missing from Kermit is the capability to easily cut and paste 
text between "windows" (sessions).  For the model of how this feature, if 
implemented in Kermit, might ideally work, sit at a DEC VT420 terminal 
and use the F1 (Copy), Select, Remove, and Insert keys to cut and paste 
raw ASCII text.  (VT420 terminals are designed for those who can type.  
Don't bother looking for a mouse port.)

[C:\] MS-Kermit>set opinion-mode on, connect

I, Jim, will continue to use MS-DOS Kermit and support its development
through the purchase of supporting documentation even if the capability to
cut and paste text within and between sessions is never added to the
program.  But I shall be very pleased if it is.

(If a VT420 can do it without Microsoft Windows, so can Kermit! ;-)

Subject: Re: What is SIXEL?

	For those who don't know about the GIGI, a little bit of history:

	Also known as the VK-100, the GIGI was DEC's Apple II:  it had Basic
	(I think from Microsoft) in ROM, and looked about like an Apple II.
	There was supposedly an ability to download and upload BASIC programs,
	but so far as I know, VMS never supported that, except through
	user-written software. 

	In about 1982 or 1983 we got several of them when I was at Kalamazoo
	College.

Yup.  The GIGI was intended for the education market.

		  They took an external monitor, with RGB cables.  As I
	recall, the resolution was at least VGA-equivalent, years before IBM
	did VGA,  and they had THREE-BIT color: black, white, red, green,
	blue, cyan, yellow, and magenta.  The funny thing was that we got them
	as part of a promotion, with a discount on some nice BARCO monitors.
	The discount was in the form of a coupon!  It was a very handsome 8 x
	10 certificate, but it was a coupon, nonetheless!

	I had the impression that the ReGIS graphics language was invented as
	part of the GIGI project, although it did show up on several later
	terminals.  Can any of the Digits on this discussion confirm or deny
	that? 

I'm 99% sure this is correct.

	The first versions of TPU, with the EDT-emulator, half-way supported
	them, but it was not a happy match.

The GIGI had an "almost VT100" terminal emulator.  It was off by enough to
give many programs headaches.

					     They were pretty much an orphan
	product at birth, but they did have the effect of making me think
	poorly of the first Macintosh as a graphics DISPLAY (512 x 384,
	ONE-BIT), since I was slow understanding the issue of a graphical USER
	INTERFACE :-(

	It has been a while since I thought about the GIGI!

Likewise!  The GIGI was not what anyone would call a success - DEC gave away
a good number of them, but it's a fair bet they never sold enough to make back
the costs.  It was a product that was a bit ahead of its times, and was also
another case of DEC not having the foggiest notion of how to market a clever
product it had managed to build.

	...The VT125 was strange in lots of ways.  The RGB output carried only
	the graphics video, while its built-in monochrome display mixed the
	graphics video with the standard VT100 character-cell video.  (This is
	different from the GIGI -- using the GIGI in "character mode" caused
	writes to the graphics bitmap.)  Had a very limited color palette and
	map, too -- you got to use a whopping four colors out of 64 available.

The original VT100 was much more than a terminal - it really was a base
display system.  There was room and power in the box to add all kinds of
interesting things.  At one extreme was the VT103, which put a whole Q-bus
backplane and an 11/23 inside the box.  There weren't any disks small enough
to put in there at the time, but everything else needed for a "PC" was there.
I've still got one - long story.

The VT125 was a similar design.  The VT100 remains unchanged - the logic
remains in the two-chip DC-something set, it has its own memory, its own
D/A converters, etc.  The graphics part of the VT125 is a completely indepen-
dent processor.  As I recall, it hooks into the incoming line in front of
the VT100, and scans the data stream for the escape sequence that enters
ReGIS mode.  Then it takes over, grabbing characters until the ReGIS command
to exit back to text mode arrives.

At the other end, the VT125 has its own screen bitmap, and its own D/A conver-
ters.  An analogue mixer combines the signals from the text and graphics
pieces.

This design has some handy features.  For example, you can scroll the text
UNDER the graphics without affecting the graphics - very handy for debugging.
People got used to this, and used it - assuming, for example, that clearing
the textual data would leave the graphics image unchanged.  They also made
assumptions about the size and positional relationships between the text and
graphics images, using textual data to anotate graphics images.

All these assumptions were invalid on every later ReGIS implementation - all
later implementations used a common bitmap for text and graphics.  Many
ReGIS-using programs failed to work properly on VT240's as a result.  GIGI's
also used the common bitmap approach, but they and VT125's were used by
disjoint groups of people, for the most part, so the incompatibilities weren't
obvious earlier.

As to the four colors:  It's hard these days of multi-megabit chips to imagine
just HOW much memory COST in those days.  I think the VT100 and VT125 use 8
Kbit chips!  That's why AVO was a (moderately expensive) option on the origin-
al VT100:  All it added was a bunch more memory.  Two bits per pixel was the
limit within the VT125's cost budget.  (By the way, you of course got your
4 colors on the "graphics" plane, plus the 4 white intensities available on
the "text" plane - yes, "bold" on the original VT100 wasn't implemented by
using a different "thicker" character bitmap, but by turning the beam up
higher.  The reverse video background was a low-intensity white.  I think bold
plus reverse used the "normal" foreground intensity.  The actual brightness
levels were quite precisely specified and controlled (relative to the general
screen brightness, of course - you could change that) - one of the high-cost
individual components in a VT100 was the high-precision resistor pack used to
implement the voltage divider that defined the screen intensities.)

Unfortunately the VT220 does not have any kind of hardware flow control,
and so the only recourse is to use Xon/Xoff.  Enable Xon/Xoff on the modem
as *local* flow control if and only if it has an error-corrected connection
and the other modem also has an effective means of local flow control with
the DTE it is connected to.

VT420 does DTR/DTS handshake only (not RTS/CTS).

Some modems can be configured to enable with DTR flow control.

VT420 has limited key remapping capabilities.

The Tilde key (upper left corner of main key array) may be
configured to send Escape when English language keyboard
is used.  Check Keyboard SetUp menu.

Can't make "<>" = Shift.

Printer port is equipped with a Digital Mini-Modular Jack (MMJ),
not RJ45.

The VT420 does not support RTS/CTS hardware flow control.  High-speed
modems with RTS/CTS hardware handshaking didn't become widespread
until several years after it came out.

Yes, you can map the tilde grave `~ key to be ESC and put tilde grave
on the angle brackets key if you wish.

By 'meta', I assume you mean a key that sets the high bit like
some non-ANSI terminals.  No, the VT420 does not support this.

 The above control sequences are part of the ANSI SGR - Set Graphics Rendition
 command and were not implemented in the VT220 or VT240.  They are implemented
 the the VT525 color text terminal.

 Character attributes such as bold are mapped to color in the VT240,
 actually VT241 which is the same system box, but connected to a color
 monitor.  There should be a SetUp screen which allows the user to
 specify colors.

 VT terminals, before the VT500 series, did not save Fkey definitions to
 non-volatile memory.  Fkeys definitions are in RAM only and are lost
 upon power off.

The VT1200 software (a LAT-based VT320 terminal emulator, and some 
old X11 server speaking both LAT and TCP/IP) is all in ROM; 
standard VMS (V5.4 and up) can be made to support "LAT X sessions" 
via XTDRIVER, and to serve its fonts via the LAT "font daemon" DECW$FD.

DECW$STARTXTERMINAL.COM, which starts both XTDRIVER and DECW$FD,
is executed during boot-time DECW$STARTUP, if you
	$ define/system	DECW$INSTALL_XTERMINAL	TRUE
within SYSTARTUP_{V5,VMS}.COM.

Allegedly AXP VMS V6.1 (AXP V1.5 was indeed lacking this "support") is 
prone to crash within XTDRIVER unless you apply the AXPDWXT01_061 ECO.

Digital Equipment Corporation has a terminal called the VT LAN 40 which
is a VT340 terminal running under a ROM version of Windows. It is 
fully network aware with LAT, CTERM, and Telnet network. It also includes
a couple of utilities like the calculator.

I'm almost certain that it is broken.

This does not sound like normal behavior for DEC products until after
their warranty has expired. Wait...HAS your warranty expired?

You must realize that DEC knows when the warranty expires just as well
as you do, maybe better.

Terminals are used for communications purposes; that is, they send and
RECEIVE data. After expiration of original or extended warranties,
many communications products suffer from symptoms similar to those
you have described.  

This is due to secret signals transmitted by DEC from an ancient
PDP-11/70 in the basement of an old hotel in the city of Cincinnati, OH.

If you don't believe me, just check in with alt.mindcontrol!

 [20 milliamp]

This is for an old interconnect standard, going back to teletype days.  The
electrical spec was:  The sender must ensure that, when a signal is
present, 20mA of current flow at the receiver.  (Actually, "sender" and
"receiver" is incorrect terminology - there was an "active" and a "passive"
end, each of which could play both roles.)  In teletype days, the sender
might put tens or even hundreds of volts across a long line to ensure the
20mA flowed at the receiver!

There was no physical connector spec for 20mA in general, but DEC used
small flat white connectors for 20mA devices.  They were made (originally?)
by Borg, and were always known simply as "Borg connectors".  They had a
latching mechanism which was a real bitch to get loose - painful on the
hands.

I think 20mA support was a VT220 option - it was a dying standard.  I don't
think any later terminals supported it.

Video out - standard RS-72 (if I remember the standard number correctly)
video signal.  Lets you connect an alternate monitor.

Not sure - you haven't described it well enough.  Is it a phone-jack-like
thing?

*Physically* it's the same connector, but I don't think you'll get much joy
from connecting a thinwire to it....

The VT102 was a member of the "second generation" of the VT100 family.

The original VT100 was sold with a number of options that could be inserted
into the box.  The most significant was the AVO, or Advanced Video Option,
which was pretty much just extra memory.  The base VT100 supported a 24x80
mode and a 14x132 mode.  It supported normal text plus one video attribute,
which could be either underlining or reverse-video - which one you got
depended on whether you selected an underline or box cursor.  AVO gave you
24x132 mode and the full four video attributes (underline, reverse, bold,
blink).  The VT100 also had a modem control option, providing extra RS-232
signals.

The VT102 was a closed system (no options) which provided the equivalent of
a VT100 plus AVO plus (I think) modem control.  It also added one or two
new commands - if I remember correctly, "Insert Line" (open a new line,
scroll stuff below it down) and "Delete Line", and perhaps "Insert" and
"Delete Character in Line".

DEC many years ago *defined* "VT100 compatibility" as "equivalent to a
VT102".  All subsequent DEC products that claimed VT100 compatibility
actually supported the full 24x132 display mode, four video attributes, and
the additional commands.  (Modem control is a separate issue - "VT100
compatibility" is usually taken to refer only to *software* compatibility.)

As far as I know, the industry has pretty much followed DEC's definition,
except that many terminal emulators are incapable of properly supporting
the 132-wide mode due to limitations of their displays.

There is absolutely no difference between the keypads of VT100's and
VT102's.

DEC uses a variety of CPUs for a variety of purposes. The VT220 is built
around an 8051, as is the LK201 keyboard. The DECmate II has, in addition to
the PDP-8 for executing user code, an 8051 for the floppies, an 8051 for
the hard disk, and 8051 in the keyboard. The DEC SCSI floppy controller is
built around the 8031, the ROMless version of the 8051. I understand there 
is/was a QBus disk controller design with a 68000 and a couple of 8051s.

You could put one on your 11/34. Rumor has it there's an 8008 in the
front panel. I haven't opened mine to see.

For more specific info, post to alt.sys.pdp8.

Other than for a few specific options, DECmates are not upgradable in the
sense that you usually reference:

DECmate {no designator} means what is now referred in retrospect as DECmate I.
The system is 32K, and is the 6120 micro implementation of the venerable PDP-8
where 32K is the normal limit for all of the usual software.  Just enough of
the alternate control memory of 32K is also implemented to handle the 
peripherals, but only to the extent of implementing overall control/status,
and booting options, and a built-in terminal emulator only if the comm board
is present.  Thus, the only options are whether there are one or two pairs
of RX01/02 (I don't think it was sold with less than RX02, but it can take
RX01 or a pair of 01 and a pair of 02 or two pairs 02), the DP278{A or B,
where B supports bit-stuffing protocols and is an upgrade later for A} dual
comm board, and the RL-278 disk controller for 1-4 RL02's which of course
puts this VT-100-like box next to a very large cabinet or two.  A printer
port is built-in

DECmate II is by far the most flexible of the family, and consists of a
repackaged machine which is the same overall case as the PRO-325 and Rainbow.
Internally an RX50 is an option technically, but is always present.  Options
include an additional pair of RX50, the RX78 external RX01/02 board {which can
control one or two pairs of mixed RX01 or RX02 drives, neither of which can
be booted to directly, and are programmed in a slightly incompatible manner
to all previous designs which were totally compatible with each other!}, a
graphics board, possibly with the VR-241 DEC color monitor {yes, a second
monitor; there is no official one-color-monitor version, but the graphics
can be directed at the non-optional VR-201 mono monitor}, and a HD controller
which can connect one MFM hard disk.  {Note that the hard disk controller
precludes the RX78 option entirely, and usually the hard disk itself is
mounted within the case which precludes the second floppy pair.  While in
theory you could cable up an external hard disk, thus allowing a second RX50
pair at the same time, some of the software cannot be configured to support
the second RX50 pair and HD at the same time.}  The HD size can be up to
a formatted 64 MB since all DEC HD controllers of this vintage reserve
dedicated alternate sectors at the beginning of the disk (which is required
to be error-free in that area) and each track has 16 sectors of 512 bytes,
a maximum of 8 (not 16!) heads.  There is some debate over whether disks
beyond 1024 cylinders are supported, but in any case they are rare in the
industry anyway.  (For example, I use an ST-4096 which is 1024 cylinders,
but actually has 9 heads, one of which is wasted, but the 1024 cylinders
are otherwise totally used.)

There was a case upgrade for all of these
machines so that larger hard disks wouldn't overburden the power supply due
to the large start-up current of many hard disks, so you can't just drop in
a hard disk without checking the power supply ECO!  The only other option
for the DECmate II is a CPU and memory board that adds either a Z80 and 64K
or a Z80, 8086, and 256K {or alternatively 512K, not an upgrade, an alternate
board!} where the Z80 can access 64K of the memory only.  The 6120 is only
indirectly interfaced to this board, and the usual software environment is
that the 6120 runs as a server for whatever is running in the APU or XPU 
board itself when they are active.  The only exception is that a portion of
DEC's WPS software actually is run in the Z80 while the 6120 waits for the
results (DECspell, footnote formatting).  All other software runs without the
optional CPU and memory boards in 32K only, however the control-panel memory
is totally implemented to 32K.  However, virtually all of it is dedicated to
functions associated with the built-in terminal emulator, etc.

The software environment on a DECmate II disk is such that each application
owns its own volume or volumes, and can be sub-booted from Master Menu.  This
is necessary due to the myriad number of O/S'es that can run on the machine
which can have up to three CPU's.  {Some applications can be called up as
separate bootable entities, but most of these are actually bootable OS/278
systems that are dedicated to running a specific application program.  In
theory, it's possible to revamp them into manually invocable utilities called
up from one copy of OS/278, but this isn't what's done normally.  In fact,
Master Menu itself is one of these!  However, there are legitimately several
families of O/S for the machine that are distinct, and Master Menu can
accommodate all of them, such as WPS, COS, CP/M-80, MS-DOS, OS/278, etc.}

The DECmate III is a reworked smaller version of the DECmate II which can
only have one pair of RX50 and no hard disk.  The only options are a reworked
APU board with a Z80 and 64K, and a graphics board.  This system must have one
monitor but it could be a VR-241 color monitor as well as the standard VR-201
mono monitor.  All systems from the DECmate II up use the LK-201 keyboard,
usually sold with the WPS keycaps, which in turn implies the blue color scheme 
for the keyboard as opposed to the more likely red, etc.  In theory, there is
also an obscure modem option whereby some specially adapted DEC "scholar"
modem of the era can be plugged into a dedicated connector on the motherboard.
I've never heard of anyone ever seeing the actual board, but it's known that
it would be compatible with an appropriate DF modem that was 300 baud and 1200
baud only.  Some newer DECmate III cases even lack the little slide-out case
section where the modem's modular phone connector would poke through, or even
the little telephone symbol that is used to label the connector.  Early cases
come with a 78W power supply, but newer ones are rated at 150W.  In a 
startling display of retro-engineering, this system uses mono-voltage power
supplies, which means that, including the DECmate III+ supplies, DEC bothered
to reinvent so many wheels that there are at least six different power supplies
to be found in this box!

The DECmate III+ superficially looks like a DECmate III, but is quite different
inside.  The main board now sports an optional hard disk controller on an
plug-in daughter board, indicating the likelihood that the system was designed
to be a replacement of sorts for the original DECmate III board, but in fact
it was never marketed that way.  This hard disk controller is compatible with
the one from the DECmate II, but due to case restrictions, mounting an
internal hard disk requires it to be half-height; only the ST-225 20 MB disk
was ever sold with it.  The built-in modem connection of the DECmate III is
still present, but they don't even implement the chips to drive the connector!
The floppy support has been revamped to use RX33 (TEAC HD) drives, but only
mimicking the RX50 at 300 RPM.  It should be noted that the DECmate III+ can
only use RX33, and the DECmate II and DECmate III can only use RX50, since
the earlier machines require device-ready drives, and the DECmate III+
requires device-change drives.  (Although the TEAC drives can be strapped to
signal ready instead of change, they are not seek-ganged as is the RX50!)
The DECmate III+ supports two RX33 drives, but due to case limitations, they
were marketed with only one drive bolted onto the ST-225 HD.  It appears that
a contingency plan could have been to sell revamped DECmate III units by
deleting the hard disk controller daughter board and adding a second RX33,
but this configuration was never sold.  The same two APU and graphics option
boards of the DECmate III can also be used in the DECmate III+ however, CP/M-80
will have problems getting implemented, since it relies on the present of the
second floppy drive, even when getting installed.  (To install CP/M-80 on
the machine, you have to at least temporarily hook up an additional floppy
drive.  To do this requires an alternate floppy cable, although the wiring
is totally straight-forward and industry compatible.  Note that an IBM-PC
or PC-clone is *not* a straight-through cable and cannot be used!)

There is rumor that there was some form of XPU board for the DECmate III and
DECmate III+, possibly with more than the 8086 w/256K or 512K of the DECmate
II XPU, rumored to contain an 80286, but none have surfaced, and it certainly
wasn't sold.

It is known that the RX33 floppy implementation is slightly deficient, in that
the RX50 versions are capable of reading-*only* one-sided IBM-PC 40-track
disks, while the RX33 cannot.  Thus, it's not possible to write a utility
to convert from IBM-PC 160K or 180K diskettes.  On the DECmate II with XPU,
this is a standard feature of MS-DOS to read one-sided IBM diskettes, etc.

DECmate III+ comes with a 160W power supply.  The only seeming difference is
that there is an additional 4-prong power connector ganged into the power
wiring, as opposed to potentially different innards from the DECmate III
supply.  As in the DECmate III boxes, the supplies come in 110V and 220V
variants, instead of a switchable version as most equipment usually is
constructed.

I can't give you a definitive answer without an IC number, but it
could be the DUART. On the basis of my investigations into the VT320
board I've got, I think that the microcontroller uses its serial
port to drive the keyboard link rather than the comms ports.
On the VT320 the device is a Motorola MC2681.

The ROM may well have a number starting with 53xxx. There should
also be some RAM -- on the VT320 they are Toshiba 5565s.

> Does someone know where I can get a schematic on the WEB for this thing?

I don't believe one exists. I've been looking for something similar
for a VT320 because I'm currently writing an emulator for the 8031 so
I can run the real VT320 ROM on my PC -- a REAL "terminal emulator"!

Please post any further information you get about this, because
I'm not allowed to take apart my (working) VT420. However, inspired
by your example, I'm going to move it onto a shelf!

Maybe, but certainly from Clearpoint.  Clearpoint wants something like
$149/4Mb, and when we told our DEC salesman that unless he could meet 
that price, we'd be forced to buy extra memory from them, he met the price.  
Dec wants ~$500/4Mb!!!

Be warned that unless you are running InfoServers, you will need 10-12Mb
before the VXT2000 can load its boot image.  They come standard with
4Mb, and can be upgraded to 16Mb.

Not sure, but we have 2 VT1300's and two VXT2000's  (all color).

The VXT2000 is more versatile, since it can log into any machine on the
net (that is running xdm), not just a fixed machine running a prompter
process.  The VXT2000 can also establish a telnet session in its own
window, if you don't want to start a full Xsession.

(With version 1.1 of the VXT software, you can supposedly do all these
things from a  VT1300, but only if running them from an InfoServer--a
separate box that handles a lot of the xterm load.  We don't have these,
so I can't vouch for how well this works.)

As far as speed goes, the VT1300's, VXT2000's, and the system console
_seem_ equally fast.  The VXT2000 can also look up hosts from your
nameserver, something the VT series can't do (at least as far as I can
see).

Don't know, haven't compared them.

Can't say, but the software comes with versions for HP's, Sun's, IBM's
and some others.

Since they came out in January, there has been one update to the

One last caution:  Make bloody sure that your salesman knows that you
have DECstations (if indeed you do).  We got the Ultrix version of the
software when we got the first VXT2000, but when the update to version
1.1 was shipped, they sent us the VMS version.  Really brilliant, since
we have no VMS machines running X on campus, and this department has
NEVER had a VMS machine.  This isn't the first time either.  The only
tape that we ever got from DEC of software for the VT1300's was for,
you guessed it, VMS.  And yes, we complained quit a bit, but it never
did any good.

Subject: re: monitors


The VS4000/VLC and VS4000/60 are variations of each other.  They use
the same bus structure, graphics and memory controllers (this might
be limited by packaging).  The BASE graphics for this workstation is
the LCG (Low Cost Graphics) and it was designed so that at the low-end
it would be capable of utilizing a SVGA-type 1024x768 monitor.  I've
personally used a small Sony on it without a problem.  And yes, it was
also designed to be able to connect to the more typical workstation
monitors, and the existing monitors used by the VS3100.

In addition, the VS4000/60 can have optional SPX/G (8-plane) and
SPX/GT (24-plane) graphics.  These are 3D graphics boards, and do
not support the low-res 1024x768 monitors, but are intended for
1280x1024 or 1024x864 workstation monitors.

All other VS4000 systems (such as the /90) use the SPX-LC (low cost)
as the base graphics.  This does not support the 1024x768 monitor as
far as I know.

What you could do is treat the device on Comm2 as a printer; go into the
GLOBAL settings of the terminal, and make sure that middle box says
S1=Comm1. Then go into the Printer setup screen, and setup the port
characteristics so that it can talk to your device.

You can go three ways from here: [1]

  * Dump the ENTIRE screen to the device. Do this by hitting the 'Print' key.

  * Get the host (on Comm1) to download the information through your
    terminal. Information sent will not show on the VT's screen.


    To turn on printer controller mode, the
    host should send:                           CSI 5 i
    to turn off:                                CSI 4 i


    Alternatively, you can just go into Printer Setup again, and change
    from Normal Print Mode to Controller Mode. Note that this is one-way
    communication; if you want the host to see what the device is
    responding with (if at all), make sure that you have 'Printer To Host'
    selected in the printer setup screen.

  * To print a selected number of lines, make the host send the following
    to your terminal:

    Tell the terminal the region to print:      CSI topline ; bottomline r
    e.g., to select lines 5 to 10: ^[[5;10r

    Tell the terminal to print only the
    things that are in that region:             CSI ? 19 l

    Tell the terminal to print it:              CSI 0 i

Personally, I'd go for the second option. No fiddling about with the
terminal settings each time you want to download stuff, and the host
does all the work for you!

Good luck!
Simon.

 The VT1200 is a standalone monochrome X-terminal.
 It came with 2 Mb RAM ( upgradable to 4 Mb ) and has all
 the software in EEPROM ( a lot of them ) so it doesn't
 need a boot server. It talks TCP/IP and LAT and can
 get it's configuration via BOOTP.

 You don't mention any keyboard or mouse, be warned that
 it needs a LK201 ( or LK401 ) DEC keyboard and a DEC mouse.
 Normal PC keyboards and mouse DO NOT WORK.

 The monitor connection that you mention is for a monochrome
 monitor, the machine has a 6-position switch that selects
 the type of monitor that is connected.
 Position 2 selects a VR319, a 1280x1024x72 Hz monitor.

 I remember seeing a description of the other settings
 in a older posting ... let's DejaNews do the work ...

This needs a separate circuit card, providing a second serial port.
The VT102 contained both AVO and the serial printer port as standard.

Part numbers for the manuals, details of the graphics option and
Setup B screen are available in the Terminals and Printers Handbook
1983-84, which is online at:

  http://vt100.net/docs/tp83/

Chapters 5, 6 and 7 deal with the VT100 family.

So you didn't find VT100.net or it didn't answer your questions? Richard
Shuford maintains a Terminal Information Archive at

  http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html

which contains lots of other information and links about all kinds of
terminals.

IIRC, EK-VT100-RC contains the same info as Appendix B of TP83, at

  http://vt100.net/docs/tp83/appendixb/

It is a PC keyboard, and Capslock-Printscreen worked! That key 
combination I would never have thought of.
Thank you very much!

PDP-7, not PDP-1 for unix.

The DECUS logo comes from the display of the PDP-1B, of which
there was exactly one build. The shipped PDP-1's were 1Cs.
I cannot remember the number of PDP-1As built, but 3 is the
number that tries to escape.

So the DECUS logo is taken from a machine that never shipped...

That is for a ROM cartridge, to completely replace the internal ROM.

A "VT110" is a VT100 with a terminal multiplexer in the box,
I found out today.

I've not been able to figure out if this thread is about the DEC VT-340,
or another product called the "340 Display".  With that in mind...

*If* it's the VT-340, or used the same video engine, the Programmer
Reference Manual reports that the resolution is 800x500, with four
color selection planes.

Joe we are talking about an old vector-drawing CRT, not the terminal type
device.

    http://www.spies.com/~aek/pdf/dec/pdp6/F-65_PDP-6_Handbook_Aug64.pdf

and tony,

Both displays had 1024/10240 x/y and a multi level intensity control.  The
screen is round but the vectors you drew were a square.   There was a
diagnostic to align the display where you draw a box 1024 by 1024 at the
outside edge and an X from corner to corner to set up a rectangular display.

God, I miss vector scopes!  The box must be almost the same as the PDP-6/346
display; I don't think DEC changed much in the way of controls, as I look at
my binary IOwords for the 340, all the bits seem to fall into place.  The
interrupt system seems the same, too.  You can get interrupts for the light
pen, or if you try to draw out of the 1024 boundry.  Maybe someone will
make a Java simulator and we could play with it in virtual space.  I don't
think holding the mouse up to the screen and pushing a button would feel the
same!!!

The tube is integrated into the rack in the 300 series. see:

    http://lhasa.harvard.edu/?page=gallery.htm

The 338/339/340's are stroke generators, and needed an analog interface.

The Type 30 has D/As in the desk, and has a digital interface.

Part of the confusion is my fault.  For quite some time, the
"DEC Terminals" page at that URL has contained the following text:

    "The next generation consisted of the VT320, VT330, and VT340,
    while a further generation comprised the VT420 and VT440."

Today I have changed it to omit the reference to the VT440 and have
put a small note to correct the false impression.

Among my collected terminal documents is one prepared by DEC as an
internal specification of the VT510 model, which consists largely of
a kind of checklist of DEC terminal models and features implemented
in each one.  Encoded in Postscript, this file resides here:

    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/dec_term_function_checklist.ps

While it contains entries for many DEC terminal types, including VT100,
VT220, VT320, VT340, VT420, and the VT510, it contains no reference to
anything called "VT440".

An educated guess on what happened: it is likely that, when the VT420
was being specified and positioned to replace the text-only VT320, DEC
decided that the design effort necessary to make a replacement for the
graphics-capable VT340 was too great, given the market projections for
sales of this hypothetical "VT440".  So the existing VT340 model was
retained in the catalog and sold alongside the VT420 until the VT525
took over as the graphics product.  Peter Sichel might know the whole
story, but he doesn't seem to read this newsgroup much anymore.

(The VT330 was an interesting beast: if I recall correctly, it could
display only text, but it could connect to two separate sessions at
the same time, displaying one on the top of the screen and one on the
bottom.  There were two serial ports, but the device could also obey
the patented "Terminal Device Session Management Protocol" to multiplex
two sessions on one wire.  Apparently the VT420 also implemented TDSMP,
but the control sequences never appeared in the product documentation.)

  [OK... writing without referring to the above information in this file,
   I forgot that the VT330 could do black-and-white graphics. ...RSS]

As to terminal emulators that can do graphics:  I have never seen a
freely available package capable of ReGIS.  A few of the commercial
products can/could do it, such as WRQ Reflection, SmarTerm 340, Rumba,
DCS EM340, poly-STAR/GW, and KEAterm:

    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/regis_emulators_news.txt

The old MS-DOS Kermit by Joe Doupnik can do the more bit-map-like
Sixel graphics, but (to my knowledge) Kermit-95 cannot.  (But perhaps
Frank will comment...)   [Frank privately agreed.]

I have no idea.

The DEC [VT420] terminal, which has no mouse or mouse-equivalent, lets
you select and paste.  While holding down the <F1> key, you use the
arrow keys to move to one end of what you want to select, use the
<Select> key to mark it, use the arrow keys to move to the other end
of what you want to select, then use the <Remove> key to complete the
selection.  During the selection, the selected text is underlined.

It can span any number of lines, or even the whole screen.

You can then paste the text you selected, by pressing the <Insert Here>
key while holding down the <F1> key.

You can insert file names, URLs, or whatever, at the command line
prompt, as part of commands, or in Google as something to search for,
or in Emacs as text to be added to your buffer, or in any other
context whatsoever, exactly as if you were retyping it.

Also, the terminal can be set up to have two sessions, and you can
use this technique to copy text between them.  The two sessions can be
onto two different computers.  Or you can have the second session in
local mode and just use it as a handy 24-line scratchpad.

This may sound unwieldy, but with practice it takes only a fraction
of a second, like typing a word or two.  It's much faster than doing
*anything* with a mouse or trackball.  (I don't actually remember in
words how to do it.  To write this message, I just did it, and watched
where my fingers went.)

It isn't perfect.  There's no way to select a rectangular region, i.e.
only certain columns of several consecutive lines.  And, like Windows
and unlike Emacs, there's only one select buffer.  If you select one
block of text then select another, the first one is no longer selected.
(That's where the scratchpad screen comes in handy.)
