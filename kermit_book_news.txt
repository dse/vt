"Using MS-DOS Kermit", Gianone, 1992
cmg@columbia.edu
KERMIT@CUVMA.BITNET
 
On the one hand, I don't like this book.  It is responsible for the fact that
the full Kermit documentation isn't included with the standard MS-DOS Kermit
distribution any more.  On the other hand, I like this book.  It is responsible
for the wider acceptance Kermit is having these days, and Kermit is an
excellent protocol, system and program.
 
Frank da Cruz can't exactly be seen as a disinterested bystander regarding all
things "Kermit", so his praise of the book and its author in the Foreword are a
bit suspect.  By the end of chapter one, however, I was willing to suspend
disbelief.  It is one of the best general descriptions of the terminal
emulation and file transfer processes I have ever read, pitched at just the
right level for the non-technical reader.  Chapter two is a quick look at
getting started with Kermit on MS-DOS, and three is a quick look at MS-DOS,
itself.  Again, chapter three is about all most people need to know to use DOS
on a hard disk, presented in admirable form.
 
Chapter four deals fully with connection of modems, serial cables and phone
jacks.  Five covers testing of the setup, and some troubleshooting tests. 
Unlike most commercial communications program manuals, who want you to call
their own BBS (long distance), the author has found an 800 number service to
try out.  (And it even works from Canada.)
 
The process of using the program starts with chapter six.  In proper
pedagogical style, the user is introduced to the invocation and termination of
the program, and the help system, along with some examples of the command
structure.  Chapter seven, entitled, "Getting Online", discusses communications
parameters, not simply in terms of the commands needed, but describes what each
parameter is, and what might result from an error.  There is a brief discussion
of MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol), which provides error correction and data
compression in modern modems), and, although I have no right to expect it, I
wish there was a bit on modem commands and settings here.
 
Chapters eight to twelve cover the basics of communications commands.  Terminal
emulation is discussed thoroughly, and leads to key reassignment.  File
transfer, in chapter nine, leads to Kermit server operations:  on the host in
chapter ten, and the PC as server in chapter eleven.  Chapter twelve covers
non-protocol ASCII transfers.
 
Chapter thirteen revisits terminal emulation with character sets and
translations.  This, of course, also covers character translations in file
transfer.  Chapter fourteen is the longest except for the command reference: 
it deals with macros and scripts.  Even here the book does not become too
technical; the intelligent novice should be quite comfortable in writing some
fairly advanced scripts.  Chapter fifteen is cute:  it covers features for the
physically, auditorily or visually challenged--and jumps from the previous ten
point type up to fourteen point in order to do it.  Network connections are
discussed in chapter sixteen and, as promised, the command reference is in
seventeen.  The command reference also covers non-standard environments and
devices.
 
The glossary that Gianone has put together is of the same quality.  Quite
complete in terms of both data communications and the MS-DOS platform, the
entries are clear and accessible to the intelligent novice.
 
Three appendices round out the book.  One is a set of tables of information,
ranging from RS-232 pin assignments through selected "Hayes compatible" AT
commands to ASCII codes.  The second is a set of terminal "escape" sequences,
while the third is a description of the files on the Kermit distribution
diskette.  At first I was a bit taken aback at the technical level of these
appendices.  These are the type of tables that I have been collecting for years
while doing communications disgnostics and consulting.  On the other hand, all
it proves is that this book is for techies, too.  I'll certainly be using it
for reference in place of some of my well thumbed old tattered pages.
 
Buy this book.  If you are thinking of using MS-Kermit, buy this book.  It is
excellent documentation, and you get a free copy of MS-Kermit with it.  If you
are thinking of using Kermit on various platforms, buy this book.  It is
excellent documentation on Kermit as a whole, since the various versions at
least make an attempt to present a consistent interface.  If you are happy with
another communications package, won't consider using non-commercial software,
use a Mac and would never be caught dead using a command line interface, buy
this book.  It is an excellent presentation of data communications, and
explains the functions, and not merely which keys to press.  The material is
broadly based, and is applicable to many systems of terminal emulation and file
transfer.
 
And who knows, you may just end up using Kermit after all ...

It seems that some of the phone numbers that were published for
Digital Press / Butterworth Heinemann / Reed Elsevier (the publisher
of the three English-language Kermit books) were wrong.

We have verified with the publisher that the following list is true and
accurate and up to date:

   +1 800 366-2665    (Woburn, MA office for USA & Canada)
 * +1 416 598-0045    (Toronto, ON office for Canada)
 * +44 1933 414414    (Rushden, England office for Europe)
   +61 2 372-5511     (Chatswood, NSW office for Australia & NZ)
 * +65 356-1925       (Singapore office for Asia etc)
   +27 031-294247     (Durban office for South Africa)
   +91 3282580        (New Delhi office for India)
   +852 5 539289      (Hong Kong)
   +55 011 492-4496   (Brazil office for South America)
 
The ones marked with * are new or changed.

We have attempted to update all our online files and Web pages, etc, to
show the right numbers.  In the meantime, anybody outside the USA who has
had difficulty locating these books is encouraged to try (or have their
bookstores try) the new numbers.

Readers in Australia and New Zealand: please note that the Chatswood NSW
office will be moving soon and the number will change.  So now is a good
time to call :-)

Of course, people in all countries can also order direct from Columbia
University.  We have all three books in English, and we also have the
French edition of "Using MS-DOS Kermit", so French Canadians need not
order it all the way from France.  See our Web page for further
information:

   http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/manuals.html

or send email to kermit@columbia.edu.

Meanwhile, there have also been reports that the German editions are hard
to find.  The first reason for this is that we published the wrong fax
number for the publisher, Verlag Heinz Heise in Hannover.  The correct fax
number is:

   +49 (05 11) 53 52-1 29

(not 53 23-1 29).  The voice number (which was published correctly) was,
and still is:

   +49 (05 11) 53 52-0

The rest of the story will be narrated by our excellent friend and German
translator, Gisbert W. Selke:

The situation is thus: Heise has run out of pre-packaged book+disk
combos. There are still books galore lying around, but they want to
package MS-Kermit 3.14 with it -- a sensible thing to do, I think, for all
the new feechures!  In order that people may make use of all the new
goodies, they want to put translated versions of the update, beware and
help files on disk.

This is currently being prepared; so, yes, in a sense, it *is* sold out,
but then again, it is *not*. I'd reckon it'll take the new books four
weeks to appear in the stores. If that's fast enough for you, fine --
you'll have it right up to date! Otherwise, if you're pressed for time and
would be content to receive the updated on-disk manuals at a later time, I
imagine they'd be willing to supply you with what they have right away.
