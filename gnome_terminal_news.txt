The "Gnome Terminal" application is part of the "Gnome Desktop" graphical user
environment, popular in Linux and becoming available in commercial Unix.  The
"Gnome Terminal" is effectively a terminal-emulator application with its own
set of quirks.

Each new generation of software reveals the depressing news that programmers
do not learn from the mistakes of the past.

Subject: gnome transition faq for X11 geeks???

Ok,

So I am transitioning to gnome. But there are a few things I am still
trying to wrap my head around. These are things that are basic in X11
with TWM or CDE, but, don't seem to be normal behaviors with Gnome.

So moving to gnome-terminal from xterm, I cam use the -geometry flag
like I do on an xterm. But, font and color flags don't work (example:
xterm -fg black -bg   yellow -fn 10x20)

I checked both the gnome-terminal and gnome-std-options man pages and
colors and fonts don't seem to be an option. This seems like such basic
functionality, (I had it with X11R3 with twm, back in the late 1980's.)
Is this not supported in Gnome? 

Or is there some "more user friendly" way to get this type of stuff.
I still can't figure out how to maximize windows in only one direction,
or set  different visual characteristics for window panel menus.

Any help would be appreciated.

You need to create a gnome-terminal profile, which is stored in the gconf
database. You then start a new terminal like this:
  
gnome-terminal --window-with-profile="BlackOnYellow"

Yep, GNOME threw out a lot of the traditional X11 stuff.  GNOME goesn't
use the X11 resource database, either, so you don't use an .Xdefaults file
anymore.

For gnome-terminal, it is all done by creating new profiles.

Yeah.  I thought it was kind of unlikely that xterm would be that
broken,  but it didn't occur to me that if "xterm" could be "xwsh"
it could also be "gnome-terminal".

I'm sorry to have cast the integrity of your fine program [xterm]
into question.

Subject: Xterminal and Redhat linux, mini How-To

Hello All,

I have found out that to get a Xterminal (NCD 17c booted with Xncd17c) to
work with RedHat Linux 6.2 you have to;

 a) switch from Gnome
    The reason being that Gnome is not very advanced technically, they have
    cut many corners in the development and also use some XFree86 proprietary
    extension to X not available on the NCD terminal.

 b) use either xdm or kdm as the display manager
    Change /etc/sysconfig/desktop to contain KDE instead of GNOME
    And/or change /etc/X11/prefdm to point out 'xdm' as the manager
    instead of 'kdm' (I use kdm because it looks better).

 c) Change /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess to have a '*' entry (there is one, just
    remove the hash mark)

 d) Change /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config in commenting out the
    DisplayManager.requestport line

Now this was kind of trivial right?

All this is down to both the security settings of RedHat (good) and the
technical knowhow of the Gnome team (bad). I myself have now switched
to KDE, all my favourite tools exist in other incarnations as KDE apps.

I find Gnome sort of like an Apple, all colour and no content?

Cheers,
Patrick

True.  The Gnome people have definitely not learned the lessons the
rest of us did years ago about supporting remote clients
(well..."servers" in X parlance).  The assumption that the server is
running on a particular OS or Server version is generally bad in X.

> b) use either xdm or kdm as the display manager

I think XDM is lighter weight than KDM, and might be preferable on
small memory xterminals.

Sorta, but such things should always be documented for the next guy
down the pipe.

>I myself have now switched to KDE,

Me too...I think it looks and behaves much better than Gnome.

However, if you've got a small memory xterminal (<= 8M), you might
find using one of the older, smaller window managers such as TWM will
help performance quite a bit.  Most people don't really need all that
cutesy window dressing that KDE (and Gnome) provide.

Of course, once I bumped my MGX to 72MB, all I had to worry about was
network speed. :-)

The real problem is that Gnome-terminal uses the xterm definition,
but isn't actually an xterm.  The real solution, IMHO, is for
Gnome-terminal to either implement xterm properly, or define its
own termcap entry (the latter would probably be best).

Well, the Gnome people claim that it emulates an xterm.  The benefit
of using an existing terminfo definition is that programs run over a
remote connection might work, because $TERM is generally forwarded.
If gnome-terminal introduced a new terminal type, it would have to
be installed everywhere, not just on systems running gnome.  There is
no perfect solution to this problem.  Replacing Sun's xterm definition
is about the best that can be done for now.

Some other terminal emulators have a flag that specifies a value
other than the default to set TERM to; if gnome-terminal had that,
it would at least let people choose between taking the chance on
imperfect xterm emulation with a widely available xterm definition,
or using a differently named terminal description that might not be
as widely available.

OT, ISTR a terminal emulator (I think it was back in the NeWS/TnT
days?) that would actually alter its behavior according to a
terminfo description, so that necessarily the description was
accurate (at least as far as its ability to do that went).  That
would be great for old apps that are hard-coded to a particular
terminal.

Yes, that's a problem.  Assumes the user knows what $TERM is.

However, I wrote a correct one for it a few years ago (part of ncurses).

The last I recall, gnome-terminal doesn't do "bce".  If I recall 
correctly, the Solaris 9 xterm (based on reading the I18N patch)
doesn't either.  Sun's "dtterm" entry is closer to being correct.
(There may be other features mismatched, but I'd have to test
rather than just glance at this posting).

Actually, if your sense of humor is perverse enough, bear in mind
that xterm emulates a DEC VT102 terminal--or superset thereof--and
try vttest:

        http://invisible-island.net/vttest/

In particular, the first few test screens (basic vt102 functionality).

Does Solaris 9 xterm implement civis and cnorm?  (It wasn't in the I18N
patch, and I don't have a Solaris 9 for testing).

Every time I run Gnome software, it spits out a long series of error
messages telling about the features that aren't working properly. 
Perhaps if I see some release-quality code from Gnome, I'll have a
better opinion of it.

I haven't been satisfied with any terminfo for gnome-terminal, since it
(like Microsoft's "telnet") always has a few bugs that break the rules that
other programs follow.  For instance (reminded that I'd neglected it for a
while),  I just added new entries, and am stuck trying to see how to make it
reliably reset colors...

For instance "emu".  I poked at it a few times, but haven't seen it running
properly (a victim of changing I/O interfaces).  That was supposedly driven
by a highlevel description of the terminal capabilitites.

There was a more recent one (name doesn't come to mind--one of those
SourceForge projects iirc) whose authors assumed that generality would be
achieved by emulating the various flavors of xterm ;-)

Subject: Re: Replacement xterm terminfo definition for Solaris gnome


According to Gary Mills <mills@cc.umanitoba.ca>:
:Gnome-terminal uses the xterm terminfo definition, but under
:Solaris 9 8/03, this definition is quite inadequate.  It lacks
:colour, and has the wrong number of lines, for example.  The

:every little detail, but it's a great improvement.

After implementing this new terminfo, will the _real_ xterm continue
to work properly?  There are times when one needs a real xterm rather
than an emulation - perhaps one needs the mouse reading capabilities,
etc.

That was my goal.  The problem is that both gnome-terminal and xterm
use the xterm terminfo definition, so if you want both of them to
work, you need a definition that suits both.

Sun actually supplies several terminfo definitions for xterm.
[The one named] `xterms' has 24 lines.
`xtermc' has colour.
Only `xterm' needs to be replaced.

From the terminal menu, edit the profile or

Subject: Bitstream Vera Fonts work with Kermit 95

Bitstream and the Gnome Project have worked to release a set of 
Open Source fonts.  The notion was to provide a free set of fonts
which could be used on Open Source operating systems unlike the
"free" fonts which Microsoft recently pulled from their web site.

These are standard True  Type Fonts (.TTF) which can be installed on
Microsoft Windows as well as  X Windows.

The Bitstream Vera Sans Mono font is not as well populated as other 
Unicode True Type Fonts, however, it is extremely readable.  One of
the nice things about the license is that the font may be modified and 
redistributed without royalties.  Perhaps someone will add the terminal 
graphics.

You can read the license and download the fonts from

   http://www.gnome.org/fonts/

You will need 'gunzip' and 'tar' in order to expand the distribution.
Perhaps Frank will be willing to place the expanded files on the Kermit 
ftp site.

A quick inspection of this font shows it's not much more than ASCII plus
Latin-1:  It has the Euro symbol, a couple Greek letters, a few letters
needed for Polish/Czech/Turkish, a few symbols from the Apple Quickdraw set
(per mille, "smart quotes", etc) and that's about it.  It doesn't even have
line/box-drawing characters (what Jeff meant by "terminal graphics").

Although it is an attractive and readable font and installs effortlessly on
Windows, it's not particularly useful for terminal emulation.  Compare
(e.g.) with Courier New or Lucida Console, both of which come with recent
Windows versions and handle most terminal emulation tasks including math,
technical, and forms, plus Greek and Cyrillic, and (Courier New only) Arabic
and Hebrew.

Somebody just showed me that by pressing and releasing Ctrl and then
typing " and a results in a German Umlaut for a. A German sz can be
realized with Ctrl and then ss.

This works for me in most GNOME applications, in normal xterms and in
StarOffice, but unfortunately not in Netscape and pine.

I also have never found this in an FAQ...

Subject: Errors/probs using Gnome-terminal on 2.4

I am using Gnome 2.4 which all appears to be working, however, when I
attempt to start gnome-terminal it takes a really long time to load,
and then I get a tiny little window that I can't resize.

If I run it from an "xterm"... I get loads and loads of errors, and still 
get a window I can't resize.  Here is an excerpt of the errors:

does it contain any <dir> beyond:

Thanks for that, Christof,

Adding the last two lines seemed to do the trick.  The performance of 
Gnome-Terminal is a bit poor compared to 2.0.2, but I now know where I 
should be looking, I'll have a tinker around to see what I can do.

Thanks for your help

The font used in dtterm is Lucida Sans Typewriter, but CDE uses the
hand-tuned bitmap version of that font.  Unfortunately, while you can
get gnome-terminal to load the TrueType version and scale it, you
can't get gnome-terminal to use the bitmap version of the font, as the
font libraries it uses don't support the .pcf.Z format of fonts.


(dtterm lets the X server open and render the fonts, using the classic X
 protocol font handling, JDS3 apps use Xft/freetype/Xrender to load the
 fonts in the client, render there, and then send the bitmaps to the
 client - with an end result of different font types being supported by
 each way, though with a large overlapping set supported by both.)

Yes, I could expound on those too.  I've figured out how to get dtterm
windows to appear where I want them on my desktop, and start up
automatically at login time.  I haven't found a way to have them start
up on specific Gnome workspaces, though.

Not that I know of - I think you'll just have to look through the list
of widgets in the dtterm man page and try to determine the name of the
text area widget and put that in your .Xresources entry instead.

OK, I'll give that a try.  (For the record, the resource I was trying to

Subject: Trouble with gnome-terminal in JDS3

This is with Solaris 10 build 72 sparc.  I've noticed a couple of
problems with gnome-terminal that don't occur with Gnome 2.0 under
Solaris 9.  Can they be fixed?

1) The [Page Up] and [Page Down] keys don't cause scrolling.  They
   do in Mozilla and dtterm.  They do work with gnome-terminal when
   shifted, but this is inconvenient and unexpected.

2) Two sets of foreground colours are interchanged.  Red appears as
   blue, and blue as red.  Likewise, yellow appears as cyan and cyan
   as yellow.  The background colours are correct.  I'm testing this
   with the ncurses colour test pattern, which is known to send the
   correct control sequences.  In gnome-terminal, I'm using the Rxvt
   pallette, which displays the standard colours with only slight
   alteration.

The colour problems seem to be framebuffer specific.  Mozilla displays
fine on my SB 100 with its m64, but red and blue are swapped (e.g., for
links) on my Ultra 60 with Creator 3Ds.

I opened a bug for this, which will hopefully be fixed for FCS.

Thanks Alan.  I tried doing this as you said, and the settings appered to
have been removed, but the key grab remained.  However, a bit of
perseverance has got me there.  I instead used Launch, Preferences,
Desktop preferences, Keyboard, Shortcuts.  The Keyboard shortcuts dialog
let me disable the three volume related bindings you mentioned above, and
that seems to have done the trick.  The nice thing about doing it this way
is that I was able to implement it on the spot without having to set it up
before-hand.

I still have the problem with smc not accepting passwords.  Perhaps I
should start a new thread on that topic.

I'll keep an eye out for the patch to bug 6239595.  Thanks very much for
your help in this matter.

Judging by some DTrace traces I saw, this is pretty much true
of GNOME, full stop.

Written by sloppy programmers using very fast machines, I suspect.

I have apocryphal (well, first hand, but I didn't actually do any real
profiling) evidence that if you want to run GNOME apps over a fairly
slow connection, especially one with significant latency (like typical
something-tunneled-over-domestic-ADSL, say), then a good way of doing
it is to run Xvnc on the remote machine, use that as the display and
then tunnel VNC.  That way all the X calls go to the Xvnc server (low
latency) and only the (effects of) ones that actually make any
difference to what is on the screen end up propagating over the tunnel.

(And of course you get all the normal VNC advantages like being able to
detach from the server.)

I think it might have something to do with anti-aliasing.
Sun's GNOME 2.0 (which doesn't have it) is very fast compared
to JDS and Blastwave's GNOME 2.8.

I used GNOME 2.0 for a while on an Ultra 60/360 dual-processor,
and noticed that there was little difference in speed between
an xterm and gnome-terminal. When switching to Blastwave GNOME
with anti-aliased fonts, one of the first things I noticed was
the extreme slowness of all text displays (e.g., in gvim as well).

Take care,

Yep:

Xterm over IPsec over ADSL is completely acceptable;
GNOME-terminal over IPsec over ADSL is not usable.

There has been work on GNOME performance for the later GNOME releases,
such as the GNOME 2.14 currently found in Solaris Express, and work is
continuing, both in the community and at Sun, for future releases.

Are you using gnome-terminal? It is really really REALLY slow to scroll,

no - the digit printed at a given location is constant, because it is
always a (nonrandom) function of the location's coordinates.

If the screensize were smaller than 24x70, the result would be
(reasonably) unpredictable.  OP did not mention this; we're assuming
it is at least 24x70.

Thank you. I'll take a look at that next time the machine goes up the creeks.
The tool appears to auto detect the keyboard correctly, as being a UK keyboard.

The machine was bought new, with the right (type 7) keyboard and mouse, so
I'm not using some older unsupported keyboard.

Subject: gnome-terminal vs. the Front/Open keys

Hey folks;

I've got an Ultra45 with two video cards in it (XVR-2500, and XVR-100).
It's running S10u8, with patches.

Since I first got it though, the front and open keys on my type 6
keyboard have failed to work with the gnome-terminal windows on the
XVR-100 display. They work with all other applications, and work fine
with the terminal windows on the XVR-2500 display, just not here.

Any suggestions? I've dug through Sunsolve and come up blank so far.

Thanks,

Subject: Future Terminal Emulator?


What Terminal Emulator do you (a Solaris admin) use on Solaris 10 and
OpenSolaris?

I know I'll get picked on here for admitting this, but as an
administrator I always go back to CDE's dtterm.  It's light-weight,
fast and stable.   (I dont' use special emulation features like some
do).

I've tried to migrate to Gnome's terminal emulator, but I find it
doesn't output text nearly as fast as dtterm.  I've attempted to turn
off the anti-aliased fonts of Gnome's terminal window, but it didn't
really speed anything up.  I suppose the gnome-terminal window is
stable and feature rich, but Gnome's desktop is a hog and "somewhat"
unstable.... compared to the battleship grey legacy CDE window
manager.

When Solaris 11 is finally released, there most likely will not be a
CDE or dtterm.


What does an old dinosaur do; just suck it up and use gnome-
terminal?   Go back to xterm?  Move everything in his architecture to
Linux?  (just kidding, don't hit me)

What are other Solaris admins using?  My daily existence consists of
man pages, ssh sessions, using cat and vim, diagnosing system and
storage performance, and lastly file system manipulation.

I'm the one who reaches for a command window instead of a file
manager.

Good advice is welcomed.

Tanx!

I share your pain, but I bit the bullet and switched to gnome-terminal
a couple of years ago. Some of the apps I use explicitly spawn xterm,
so I use that too. I still have to revert to dtterm for one or two
things which make extensive use of curses - gnome-terminal and xterm
just don't have sufficiently working termcap/terminfo entries for
anything which uses curses more fully than vi does.

One of my own applications uses -S (slave mode) which gnome-terminal
doesn't support, so for that I have to use xterm or dtterm.

dtterm is decent, except I wish it had the alternate buffer so that
the display would be restored to what it was before running something
cursor-addressible like vi.

Newer versions of xterm don't totally suck.

From what I've seen, you aren't the only one less than thrilled with
gnome-terminal.

I would suppose that if one brought forward the right files, the old
CDE stuff would still work.  Trick would be to do so _carefully_, not
overwriting anything new.  Not that I've yet tried to retrofit CDE
on top of OpenSolaris (the distro) or anything like that.

I'll definitely miss CDE; it's not heavy on eye-candy, but it's
decently fast, and plenty customizable as long as one doesn't
mind getting one's hands dirty writing shell scripts, action
definitions, and suchlike.

Have been using xterm since I don't know when, perhaps 80's.  Certainly in

I wouldn't be surprised if there were none.

- What you see in xterm, is (somewhat automatically) implemented
  by means of the translation tables in libXt.

- rxvt avoids linking libXt by intention, aiming at a smaller footprint.

- younger terminal emulators might consider libXt as oldfashioned.

BTW, see also

As a preparatory step towards switching to gnome-terminal, I wrote a
small program for faking keypresses, which can be bound to keys in
GNOME preferences.  See:

I rather like Aterm myself. its very lightweight and based off of rxvt.
I have mine compiled to use a NeXT style scroll bar on the left hand side.

I also love CDE and haven't even considered switching. I have my "find"
key set up to launch Aterm when I press it with a black background with
lime-green text for nostalgic purposes.
