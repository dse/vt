These projects can be immense, depending on the number of users you have
and their usage of the features in Extra.

Migrating macros and applications based on COM interface or HLLAPI can
be very labor-intensive and frought with error.  There is a lot more to
these products than just the green screen.  While both products provide
terminal emulation, you'll find differences with the default keyboard
maps, fonts, and--to some degree--even with the way terminal emulation
is handled.  Extra has a lot more features than PCOMM as well--users may
cry out when you take some of the features they value away.

In a nutshell, these projects can be big.  What is driving your need to
switch?

You don't. Nearly every AS/400's serial ports are setup for sync 
communications.  A com port has a line description and controller 
description that determins how the AS/400 comm support treats the modem. 
Generally modems are controlled by V.25bis commands sent by comm support.  
Async modems using AT commands are extremely rare. I have never seen one. If 
you insist on async then an Async Line Description and ICF will let you work 
with AT commands but it is a lot of work. (ICF Programmers Guide, SC41-9550 
and Asynchronous Communications Programmers Guide, SC41-9592)

You access comm SERVICES (SNADS, DDM, ICF, CPI-C, FTP, TELNET...) through 
that services API's. You configure the comm service to use the AS/400 comm 
support (SDLC, BISYNC, LAN, ISDN, TCP/IP...).  You configure AS/400 comm 
support to use the comm hardware on your system(serial port, TokenRing, 
Ethernet, Frame Relay...).

The advantage of this setup is that your application does not have to know 
anything about how you connect with your target, you simply call the API 
(SNDNETF to send a file with SNADS, FTP to send a file with FTP...).  If one 
layer changes (ie. you switch from SDLC to Frame Relay), your application 
does not give a damn.

If you want to attach a terminal then what you want an ASCII Workstation 
Controller.  There is a programmable IO controller that you can program like 
a PC to work with comm support and async devices. I don't remember the model.

The style of programming that you describe, which is common on PCs, 
assumes that the *application* controls all aspects of comm.  In a large 
application (say, EDI to exchange PO's and invoices with trading partners), 
your average application programmer has enough to do to keep track of

  - the EDI document formats that your trading partner uses
  - how open orders, payables and receivables get generated from the
    Purchase Orders and invoices
  - how to send confirmations
  - which General Ledger accounts get debited and credited

...to really give a rat's ass about trapping a modem setup.

I would recomend that you analyze what comm service your users need, learn 
what has already be provided for you in OS/400 and then learn to configure 
the comm service to use a comm support and configure comm support to use comm 
hardware.

Ya, I know, it's a lot to learn, and you already know how to program a Hayes- 
compatible modem with Procomm Plus.  Well, things are different here.

You can, if the AS/400 has an ASCII Workstation Controller.

Many moons ago the consulting firm I worked for at the time had a client that 
used a ASCII terminal as the console. The one weird or strange thing he had to 
report was that he was forced to use a specific IBM ASCII terminal and not one 
of the WYSE ASCII dumb terminals he had sitting around.

I have no idea if this was truly a requirement or if the requirement is still 
forced upon AS/400 users today.

Hope that helps a little.

Of course you are assuming that they have a twinax controller attached to the
P03.

We received one with out the Twinax but with a token ring.  In this environment
IBM supplies a special version of CA/400 to connect a PC via the Comm ports on
the P03.  This PC will then operate as the console.  There was also a cable,
that IBM supplied, to connect the Serial port of the PC to the AS/400 comm
port.

If you want to run those products you will have to by an OEM product that 
supports Procomm.   You can install PC Support or Client Access on your 
laptop and configure it for Async communications.  If you already have PCS on 
your AS/400 it is free and does not require other products.  (I may be wrong 
about the OEM product, but I know of no one that is doing this without them.)

You can have subystems acquire specific devices by name. This can be done by 
adding workstation name entries to the QCTL subsystem.  If you look at the 
Subsystem Description (wrksbsd) you will see options that will allow you to 
do this.  (Workstation name entries)  The work management guide will give 
you better details of how to do this.  You really just add the names of the 
devices to the subsystem. (ADDWSE I think)

There is something that you should be aware of.  If other subsystems, QINTER 
for example, define the attached device by device type.  Your devices may be 
acquired by QINTER or QCTL.  It works like this.  Let's say the you name you 
device DIAL1 and that it is a defined as a 3197.  If you add the workstation 
name entry to QCTL for DIAL1 and QINTER allows 3197 or *ALL device to run in 
it.  Then the first subsystem to get CPU time will acquire the device.  If 
QINTER is first, it will acquire DIAL1 because it is a 3197, If QCTL is first 
it will aquire DIAL1 because it is specifically named.   If this sound like 
the voice of experience, it only because it is.  What you need to do then is 
to define where all the 3197 will go by name for each subsystem that they 
will be running under and not use the *all for the other subsystems.  They 
will have to be changed to specify all devices except 3197s.  This can take 
some time, as you can see.

Our site is running CA/400 Windows 3.1.1 but are using FTP's TCP/IP
stack. Your messages, though in Norwegian, seem similiar to ones I saw
in English.

Have you set CHGNETA so that Allow ANYNET support is *YES?

Have you set the  Local Network ID via CHGNETA to the 2nd qualifier of
your TCP/IP site name?

Have you set the SNASUFFIX in the AUTOEXEC.BAT to the 3rd qualifier of
your TCP/IP site name? If nothing is entered then IBM assumes
APPN.SNA.IBM.COM as the 3rd,4th,5th and 6th qualifiers of your site
name.

Does your ANYNETPATH point to your CA400 directory?

Does your path include CA400 and CA400/BIN? It should.

If you're using a Domain Name Server does it have an entry for your
AS/400 that uses the Local Control Point as the first qualifier? It
should. Check the value by issuing DSPNETA.

If you're not using a Domain Name Server then you need a HOST file
available to each workstation that resolves your AS/400 site name.

Hope this helps....

Assuming you are talking about using an async connection, yes, you do use 
ICF files to accomplish this.

More to the point, you will need to define async line, controller, and 
device descriptions to get a location name to refer to, then you will 
create an ICF file as an ASYNC type that points to the location in the 
async device.

Using this method it is possible to completely automate an Async 
connection, including sending "AT" dial strings, waiting for a connect, 
etc.

For more information, see the Asyncronous Communications Programmers guide
(or something like that - don't have the manual handy now.)

To test your device descriptions, you can use the STRITF command which is a
poor man's (destitute actually) terminal program for async connections via 
the AS/400.

I have done this, it is NOT easy by any means.  If it is possible to do 
your queries via TCP/IP, you may find that easy to handle.

For more info, try using a subject like "Anyone doing Async?", or if you 
really want a lot of replies, "Why can't the AS/400 do Async?" <- beware! 
be prepared with flame-proof underwear if you try this one.

Another option is use the pcAnywhere to remotely control a host PC running 
 AS400 emulation. The host PC is locally attached to the AS400. You should 
be able to get a used PC for the local host for about U.S. $300 or less 
and a new emulation card for $99. And there are variations on this.

John, #2 in the above list implies that V3R2 will allow dial in
terminal emulation using SLIP over async modems  without 
needing an ascii workstation controller.  Is this correct or just
wishful thinking on my part?  If so what hardware other than
a communications card (the pc, and the async modems of
course) is required?

There are a number of options available to you.  If you have an ASCII
workstation controller you may dial in using almost any type of high speed
modem and a terminal emulation software program.  Another option is, as you
stated a 5250 emulation board or PCMCIA card.  Yet another option (and a
personal favorite) is to purchase a program called 5250 Remote from Micro
Integration.  This program allows a synchronous dial-up connection without
the need for a 5250 board (note: a requirement of this package is a Hayes
Auto-Sync capable modem .. I use a Hayes Optima).

Subject: 3174's

Hello,

I am recommending hardware for a new datacenter and am considering
four 3174 model 22L's for MVS consoles (4 lpars).  I would also like
to know if a 3174 configured as NON-SNA (for MVS console use) can
support AEA also?

I am aware that the eight AEA ports probably would take away from the
32 addresses available, and thats no problem.  I just need to know if
this will work, or I need to order another 3174 just for AEA ports?

Thanks
Dana

Just did the same thing. Replace 10 old 3274 clunkers with 6 3174-22Ls.
And the rack mounts take up much less room in the 9309 racks.

There are a few tricks you can do with just have 4 slots for adapters.
The Asynch Adapters are addressed differently; so even if you only
have 3 TMAs, you can still get 32 addresses (DFT terminals can use the
addresses where no hardware exists), plus the 4th non-TMA port gets 25
devices plus the Asynch.  Non-SNA can only port config, etc.  I just
need to check about the Asynch.  I think you can do exactly what you
want.  Be sure to get correct microcode and level, plus enough memory.

It may have been overkill, but for a low price, each 3174 has 6M,
ESCON, 3 TMAs, 1 Asynch Adapter (I'm thinking only 3 have them), and
with 2 ESCON Directors plus SYSPLEX, all the backup we need for 7
LPARs.  Send me a note if you want more info.

The 7171 is a protocol conversion box that provides IBM 3278
emulation for a large set of standard async ASCII terminals. It
grew out of a research project at Yale that eventually produced a
beastly gadget called a Series/1 that did essentially the same
job, but was much more difficult to configure and use.

The 7171 is essentially an industrial grade PC with a 370 channel
interface and up to 64 async ports (minimum 8, expandable in 8
port increments) running a embedded program that translates
keyboard input from popular ASCII terminals to the 3270-style data
streams that IBM mainframes expect. It also translates 3270 data
streams from the host into appropriate escape sequences for 
each type of supported ASCII terminal by doing lookup of
sequences stored in EEPROM. Users can add new terminal types by
running a configuration program on an ordinary IBM PC or PS/2 and
download the configuration into the controller via a serial line.

It's a very well-thought out box -- IBM did a good job with the
Yale research.

Some sites provide TCP access to their IBM boxes by attaching a
terminal server to the async ports on a 7171 and configuring the
terminal server to rotor between free ports, like this:


          |               |--------|
    net   |               |        |========
          |   |------|====|  7171  |========  large IBM iron
          |---| TS   |====|        |
          |   |------|====|        |
          |               |--------|

Users can then 'telnet' to the terminal server and be
automagically assigned a 7171 port w/o having to drag serial
cables all over the place (assuming their 'telnet' does a
reasonable terminal emulator that the 7171 can understand --
although 7171s can deal with terminals as dumb as ADM-3s, so it
doesn't have to be much). It's a pretty smooth setup, once you
get all the configuration stuff right in the terminal servers
*and* get the right cables and modem signals rigged between the
terminal server and the 7171.

My guess is that the original poster has probably set up
something very much like this and is having some problems getting
everything set up and working smoothly.

            babysat several of them in different places, and

I have not seen any responses on this that helped you with the 7171 problems
so I thought I would try to help by sharing the problems I recalled.

I developed a terminal server for TRW and I eventually had a field engineer
interface one to a 7171 in a milking machine fashion.  There were a few
problems I had to contend with.

	1. At the time the 7171 did not do xon/xoff flowcontrol properly
	   
	   Symptom: The network conection would appear to lock up or
	   have character loss.
	   
	   Analysis:
	   After looking at a lot of serial data analyzer output, I discovered
	   that when the terminal server flowcontrolled the 7171, the
	   7171 not only discontinued the transmission of normal data traffic
	   but also discontinued sending xons/xoffs, which caused it to
	   enter a "catch 22" state where both sides were flowcontrolled
	   and neither could release flow-control until some action was
	   taken by the other or it would drop characters on the floor
	   because the 7171 refused to inform the terminal server that it
	   could not receive any more characters.
	   
	   Resolution:
	   IBM fixed their code by offering an option to either allow
	   flowcontrolling of flowcontrol characters or a mode that
	   I needed to succeed that allowed flowcontrol characters to
	   be transmitted.

	2. The 7171 that I was interfacing to required that certain hardware
	   lines be asserted to transmit characters to the unit.  Once those
	   lines were asserted the 7171 began transmiting characters almost
	   instantly.

	   Symptom: The user would see a message the looked like this
	   "gin:" instead of "Login:" (I dont remember the actual message
	   but it was some sort of logon message)

	   Analysis:
	   When the hardware line were asserted the network link was not
	   quite up.  It was a couple character times off

	   Resolution:
	   I fixed my code.

	   I mention the second problem just because the 7171 was the only
	   device I ran into that exhibited this operation.

Disclaimer:  My experiences with the 7171 are specific to interfacing 
	     problems I experienced about 3 to 4 years ago.  I am not
	     an expert on the 7171, just good with terminal servers
	     and serial devices.

Subject to final approval, we have a couple of 7171s (grand-child of the

We're keeping 2 of the 7171s.  They're great!  When OPS calls and says the

Hi S|ren,

if your AS/400's are all connected to the same network (Ethernet /
Tokenring) you can assign IP addresses to the interface card (CFGTCP,
option 1). For the IP addresses, subnetmask and gateway, you should consult
your network administrator.  

Next you start TCP and you are able to telnet to the AS/400, FTP and so on.

If your AS/400's are remote you could consider installing routers connected
through leased lines (if the traffic between the AS/400 justifies the
investment).

Otherwise you could establish an IP connection via SLIP (V3R7) between the
AS/400's.

Anyway, you should take a look at the OS/400 TCP/IP Configuration and
Reference guide. 

Kind regards,
Rob Kamphuis

        Unfortunately we can't replace anything.  The 3705 sits at a
remote site that we want to connect to.  Typically, for EDI I would
use ProComm to establish a dial-up and go from there.  I did submit an

would support the TWX TTY emulation.  If it does, then we would be

It's not a question of scripting.  The short answer is: Kermit will
probably work, but you'll have to try it to make sure.  The long answer
follows.

We had a 3705 here twenty-some years ago, and had the recently mentioned
Hazeltine 2000 terminals attached to its ASCII ports.  The H2000 is a
regular plain old ASCII terminal, so if it can be used, so can Kermit.
Note that terminal emulation does not even enter into the equation.
This type of connection is half-duplex, line-at-a-time, 7-bits-with-parity.
There is nothing terminal-specific about it.

Therefore you should be able to use any terminal emulator that supports
half duplex, local echo, 7x1 (where x usually = M), and the appropriate
speeds (usually 1200, 4800, or 9600 bps).

The interesting part comes if you also want to transfer files over the
connection.  In this case, I would venture to say that Kermit is
uniquely suited for this task, since operation through 3705 linemode
connections was one of the original design constraints for Kermit
protocol and software.

Reliable file transfer (i.e. with error detection and correction) with
the mainframe requires the CICS version of Kermit on the far end:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k370.html

Unreliable (non-error-checked) transfers can also be done in case the
mainframe does not have CICS Kermit (but I would not recommend
unreliable file-transfer methods for EDI applications).

A special group of settings is used on the PC's Kermit program, usually
something like:

  set part mark
  set duplex half
  set handshake xon
  set prefixing all
  set window 1

These are explained the Kermit manuals and books.  We used Kermit in this
environment for many years, until the 3705s were phased out, but with a
different OS on the mainframe (OS/MVT and then VM/CMS, rather than CICS).

Check the Client Access SSL option to encrypt your connection to the 
AS webserver.

I wouldn't use my webserver as a telnet gateway to my production
machine; instead I would search for some kerberos / radix alternative
either on Linux or specialized box. Yes  I know it can be more expensive
to have a Linux box/lpar  doing that, it is just an issue of cost-risk
you have to evaluate.

Regarding the CA SSL, do a search on http://www.iseriesnetwork.com/
for a step-by-step article on how to configure it: pretty straightforward.

There are some docs on the IBM web site. Try

   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/3270hcon/hconugd/HiLevLang_intrfc_3270Host.htm

or the two other above.

Not sure what the current status but Attachmate and Wall Data  used to have
controls to do most of what you want.

To do tn3270E (non printer) terminals then you need to define an effectors
and a listener.  The tn3270E function from CSI supports the LU name in the
definition  only.  If you need to define printers then GPS is needed

DEFINE TELNETD,ID=TN3270E,TERMNAME=TNET9,TARGET=ADMCICS,COUNT=05, -
               LOGMODE=NSX32702,PORT=3270,TN3270E=L,POOL=YES
DEFINE TELNETD,ID=TN3270L,TERMNAME=TNET9,TARGET=ADMCICS,COUNT=35, -
               LOGMODE=NSX32702,PORT=3270,TN3270E=E,POOL=YES

Now if you just want extended attributes for the terminal then a regular
definition will work as long as you specify the correct dlogmod

DEFINE TELNETD,ID=TNADMN6,TERMNAME=TNET6,TARGET=ADMCICS,COUNT=90, -
               LOGMODE=NSX32702,PORT=2366,POOL=YES

Subject: 5250 Terminal Server for Linux
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The communication between the AS400 and a Client Access of IBM is
implemented over the 5250 data stream.
I would like to communicate over the 5250 data stream with the Client
Access of IBM to a Linux-Server.

The first question:
Does Linux support the 5250 data stream?

The second question:
Is a 5250 terminal server still existing?(For Linux)
This server should be able to model a 5250 data stream from the AS400.

I can't believe that nobody had worked / solved such a problem before.

I would be very much pleased for help and suggestions.
Best Regards, Peter Hysek

Not directly. You will have to find and install an SNA support package for
Linux. While there /was/ an Open Source SNA package (hosted by samba.org), I
don't think that it exists any more. You might be able to get an SNA package
from IBM, though.

OTOH, you might have better luck with TN5250, which emulates the SNA 5250 over
TCP/IP through the use of an intemediary service that converts TCP/IP to SNA.


| The second question:

Yes, as a TN5250 client. A quick "freshmeat" [software-project] query gives

    http://tn5250.sourceforge.net/

(and an indirect lead through a tn3270 project).

Client Access for UNIX (a port of the Windows version) runs under
Linux and supports 5250 access. More info on

Probably not possible directly, can you go through an AS/400 and
telnet from that to your Linux box?

Or you could use a Unix terminal emulator on your client and
tn5250 from the linux box to an AS/400.

It does support it via terminal emulators.  I can connect from a Linux
box to an AS/400 see TN5250 as a GPL example.

To my knowledge no 5250 terminal server has ever existed on UNIX.  Why
do you wish to communicate with a Linux box over 5250 when other more
traditional protocols are readily available?


> I can't believe that nobody had worked / solved such a problem before.

Why would anybody in their right mind want to implement a terminal
server in 5250 on Linux?

VT100 etc is the standard for Unix terminal servers.  5250 is the
standard for AS/400.  If I wish to communicate with both machines I have
to have both emulators on my client box.  Or I have to use some sort of
pass through arangement.


> I would be very much pleased for help and suggestions.

A little more info as to why 5250 from a Linux box is required?
