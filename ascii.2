Back in the mid '60s, most of DEC's software depended on the presence of a 
left-arrow. The PDP-6 PIP syntax used a command string like:

RESULT.FIL<-FILE.FOO,FILE.BAR

to combine two files, only the "<-" was a single character left-arrow; or as 
we called it then, a backarrow. When presented with a TTY with an alternate 
keyboard we substituted the underscore key. It was only when terminals 
without backarrows became common that we changed the CUSPs (anyone still 
remember that term) to accept the equals sign in place of the backarrow. At 
least with an arrow it was clear which argument was source and which 
destination.

TOPS-10 had a COPY command which invoked PIP. When I first started to use 
DOS, I had a terrible time getting COPY to do what I meant.

CUSPs... Sure. Still use 'em. :-)

Anyway, you skipped a step. The change wasn't immediately from the backarrow
to the equal sign. In between, dec used the '<' instead of the backarrow
in CUSPs.

It's still the character you use in OS/8, if you don't feel like using
the underscore (unless you have a real TTY).

Now, how many knows what a TTY *really* is? :-)
