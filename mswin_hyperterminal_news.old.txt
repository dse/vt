Lore of the "Hyperterminal" and "Telnet" programs that come with MS Windows

Or "used to come", as with Windows Vista, Microsoft has stopped bundling
Hyperterminal.  To quote from this web page, circa A.D. 2008:

Hilgraeve, Inc., the company that actually wrote HyperTerminal for
Microsoft, later came out with "Hyperterminal Private Edition".  This
improved version of the program is available for download from:

As of 2007-03-26, version 6.3 of HTPE is current.  Use of HTPE is free to
individual users, running on a machine owned by the user, and use is free to
academic users.   Businesses may purchase a license for corporate use under

Microsoft's hints on using Hyperterminal to establish a serial connection:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/tdhelp40/htm/connectwithserialadmin.asp

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Microsoft provided the basic Hyperterminal and "telnet" programs which perform
some kind of emulation of a character-cell, more-or-less-ANSI-type terminal.

When considering these programs, keep the following thought in mind: almost
always, when you are using these programs, you will be using them to connect
to a non-Windows operating system.  It is *not* in the economic interest of
Microsoft Corporation that doing so should be *easy* for you.

Also, keep in mind that the unadorned telnet protocol is not secure. You may
wish to look into SSH, Kerberos, and other means of making secure connections.

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

To quote from Nathan Mercer (http://blogs.technet.com/nmercer)...

Note that if you don't actually need Telnet, but remote shell access,
you can use WinRS (Windows Remote Shell) which is new to Vista.
At a cmd prompt, type "winrs /?" For help.

Subject: Problem with Terminal Emulators - VT100 VS ANSI

Hi All

     I have a problem with terminal emulation. My program runs in a
system which is redirected via a serial port to another system. I use
Windows 2000's Hyperterminal to receive the redirected console.

     When the Emulation Mode is set to VT100 on both ends, everything
works fine. But when the Emulation mode is set to ANSI on both ends,
the received console is corrupted. This happens only when the "Wrap
Lines that exceed Terminal Width" option in the Hyperterminal is
turned ON. If that option is turned OFF, then there are no problems.
The thing to note is that I dont use more than 80 columns in any part
of my program. So how is this option affecting the redirected console
? Are there any differences in the escape sequences between the VT100
and the ANSI in particular to insertion of LFs or something like that
? All ideas are welcome.

Thanks.

Regards
Ravi.

Subject: Re: Problem with Terminal Emulators - VT100 VS ANSI

There are two issues here.  First, the VT terminals handle word wrap
differently from most other terminal types based on ANSI X3.64-1979.
When a character is written to the last column of a row the cursor
does not move to the next line until after one more displayable
character is received.  Most other terminals move the cursor to the
next line immediately after the character is written to the last 
column of the row.  Therefore, if your host application relies on
the behavior of the VT terminals, you will need to use an emulator
that implements it.

Second, there is no such thing as an "ANSI" terminal.  All that "ANSI"
means is a terminal definition based on a standard ANSI X3.64-1979 (now
ECMA-48 / ISO 6429).  This standard is a *framework* for building terminals.

Simply having a terminal derived from this standard is not enough
information to determine how to handle the input stream.  Examples of
terminal definitions based on this standard--that are incompatible--are:

  IBM PCDOS ANSI.SYS display driver (aka BBS ANSI)
  Sun Solaris Console
  Linux Console
  BeOS Console
  VT100,101,102,121,220,240,320,420,510,525
  SCO console (SCO ANSI or AT386 depending on version)
  QNX ANSI (QANSI)
  Wyse 370
  AIXTERM
  XTERM
  AVATAR/0+
  IBM High/Low Function Terminals
  SNI 97801
  
and there are many, many more.

What is meant by most vendors that claim to support "ANSI" is the
IBM PC-DOS ANSI.SYS display driver. Using this implementation with
an application that expects any other terminal type will result in
unexpected and undesirable behavior.

As I said before, I use two systems, one of which is an IA64-based
system and the other is a Desktop PC running the hyperterminal. The
IA64 system offers console redirection via the serial port with the
following three terminal standards - PCANSI, VT100, and VT100+.

So, first, what is this PCANSI standard and where does it fit in the
list given by you ? Next, the hyperterminal doesnt have an option for
PCANSI. So I chose ANSI as ther terminal emulation mode in
hyperterminal resulting in the line wrapping and the screen scrolling
up causing the corruption. So are these two incompatible ?

Finally are there any other terminal emulation software available with
PCANSI standard support ?

Thanks and Regards
Ravi.

The Kermit Project tested Kermit-95 against the Hyperterminal program
that comes free with Windows, and the results may been seen at:

    http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95hyper.html

The Kermit testers say that the actual behavior of the Windows Hyperterminal
program stays exactly the same, regardless of which choice the user makes for
emulation mode.

According to Microsoft's Knowledge Base, connections from Windows 98 telnet
to a telnet server may seem slow if the server does not follow RFC2018.  To
speed up the session, you can disable the TCP Selective Acknowledgement
Options (SACK) feature using Registry Editor.
Enter a data value of zero (0) for the SackOpts value in the following
registry key:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP
(Note that you may have to create the SackOpts value. If you have to create
the SackOpts value, create it as a string value.)

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

There is a potential security-related buffer-overflow vulnerability in the
HyperTerminal program that is included with Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows
98/SE (Second Edition, and Windows Me (Millennium Edition). This vulnerability
could potentially allow arbitrary code to be run on a user's computer.

Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 contains the fix.

Subject: Suninstall & Hyperterminal emulation

When using a MS Hyperterminal window, and running suninstall, the arrow
keys don't work.

I chose VT100 emulation in Suninstall, and VT100 in Hyperterminal
emulation settings,
tried the arrow keys on the numeric keypad, and the vi keys H,J,K,L
these also don't
change the box I want to edit.  spacebar, delete, backspace (^H) don't
erase.

Tried different settings in Hyperterminal File->Properties->Settings
and other than choosing "VT100" (which cleared up the screen), none
seemed to fix this issue.

Anyone run into this before?

Cheers, D Ryan

I found the answer to my own question.

The Tab key moves the "input focus" down and
"Return" puts the X in the box you want, when
the arrow keys, space bar, and X key don't do
anything.

Which operating system?  And which version of Hyperterminal?

The Hyperterminal version that's included with WinNT 4.0 won't generate
the RS232 break signal.  Upgrading to Hyper Terminal Private Edition,
( it's free for personal use, see http://www.hilgraeve.com/ ) solves
the problem.  The key sequence is ctrl+break.

Yeah! My systems console is connected via a serial port to a terminal
server and I log on to the termial server(runs some Linux) using my
Sun Blade. I tried sending in a break signal from my blade but it
didnt help. In fact I tried ctrl+pause.

Is ctrl+pause==break??

It depends on your terminal emulator program (look for docs).

If you use tip, it's a ~# sequence.

If HyperTerminal (Windows prog, you know), Ctrl-Break...

If telnet to some terminal concentrator - ^], "send brk", and so on ...

 As Igor says in his follow-up it really does rather depend on your
 terminal server.  For example, the default character sequence for
 sending BREAK on a Lightwave Console is

ESC B

 but on a Lightwave you can configure it to something of your own
 choosing.  You're not sending the BREAK directly from your keyboard,
 by typing a peculiar character sequence on your keyboard you're
 trying to convince the terminal server to send a BREAK to the
 console.  Time to RTFM!  :-)

Cheers,

        Ian

Some users have reported success generating a serial BREAK condition
under Microsoft's HyperTerminal by typing

(Hold down the 'Ctrl' key, press the 'Esc' key; let keys up, then press 'F'.) 

I don't know to which versions of Windows this pertains.
