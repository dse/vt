 The very first question EVERYONE asks when first
 sitting down at a Wyse terminal is:

    How do I turn off the keyclick?

 Over the years, a variety of people have discussed
 this question in  "comp.terminals".  Here is one
 example....

Indeed.  You can toggle the keyclick with (control-) shift-enter.  Once it
is OFF (or on if desired) go into the setup mode and save the setup.
The keyclick will be "saved" in whatever mode you left it in.

 Once the clicking has ceased, the user next
 notices that "vi" is not working correctly.
 The lucky ones eventually discover that the
 problem is an incorrect termcap or terminfo
 entry supplied by the Unix vendor. The less
 perceptive users blame it on Rush Limbaugh.

Here's some of the technical stuff regarding the status line:

(All the following data is from the book "termcap & terminfo"
ISBN#0-937175-22-6.  I recommend everyone that reads this group get a
copy, it can answer most of the more specific questions [like the one
above] with a complete listing of termcap and terminfo capabilities.
It will change your life. Run right out and buy a copy!)

    http://www.ora.com/gnn/bus/ora/item/term.html


The Wyse 50's status line can be written to, so at least 'hs', 'ds='
and 'ws#' should be defined ('hs', 'tsl=' and 'fsl=' for terminfo
respectively).  However, 'ts=' and 'fs=' don't apply (strictly
speaking) since the escape sequence for this terminal takes the data
to place in the status line as an argument.

To write to the status line (called the 'host message field' by the
Wyse 50 documentation, the command:

<escape>F<46 or 100 character message><carriage return>

would need to be broken up into two parts:

(for the 80-column Wyse-50 termcap entry)  (for the equiv. terminfo entry)
:hs:ws#46:ts=\EF:fs=^m:                    hs, fsl=46, tsl=\EF, fsl=^m

(for the 132-column Wyse-50 termcap entry) (for the equiv. terminfo entry)
:es@:ws#100:tc=wyse50:                     es@, fsl=100, use=wyse50

One problem is that programs will need to use the "fs=" capability
immediately after sending the "ts=" entry and writing no more than 46
or 100 chars.  This involves planning and using the termcap/terminfo
database entries correctly.  In my experience, getting most
programmers to use the more common termcap and terminfo capabilities
correctly is not easy, so getting them to use these capabilities
correctly is probably going to be even tougher.  Any program that puts
more data than the status line can hold or thinks that the data should
end with a carriage return (instead of a "fs=" definition, the two
should be handled differently since the status line will only "absorb"
one of them) is broken, the termcap/terminfo definition is fine.

Notes:

* The message can be 46 chars long if you're in 80-column mode or 100
chars long if you're in 132-column mode.

* "es" (termcap and terminfo) means "can use other defined escapes on
the status line" and "es@" negates "es".

* "tc=" ("use=" in terminfo) means to include the termcap (terminfo)
definition for another terminal MINUS the attributes defined up to
that point.  Termcap requires only one "tc=" and it must be at the end
of the entry.  Termcap also requires that the end result of chaining
entries not be more than 1024 (1k) characters.  Terminfo allows more
than one "use=" entry to be given and makes no size restriction on the
total length of the entry.

=============================

There is another addressable area of the Wyse 50's status line (called
the 'local message field' in the documentation) and a way to allow
escape characters in the so-called 'host message field'.  The catch is
that the ENTIRE field has to have the same display attribute.  That
is, the 'local message field' and 'host message field' can have
different attributes, but the entire 'local message field' must have
the same attribute and the entire 'host message field' must have the
same attribute.

Using:

<escape>A2<display attribute code>  to change the local message field
<escape>A3<display attribute code>  to change the host message field

Here's a list of display attribute codes:
<space>  space code (20H)
0  normal               4  reverse             8  underscore
1  blank (no display)   5  reverse and blank   9  underscore & blank
2  blink                6  reverse and blink   :  underscore & blink
3  blank                7  reverse and blank   ;  underscore, blink & blank

<  underscore & reverse                 p  dim
=  underscore, reverse & blank          q  dim & blank
>  underscore, reverse & blink          r  dim & blink
?  underscore, reverse, blink & blank   s  dim & blank

t  dim & reverse          x  dim & underscore
u  dim, reverse & blank   y  dim, underscore & blank
v  dim, reverse & blink   z  dim, underscore & blink
w  dim, reverse & blank   {  dim, underscore, blink & blank

|  dim, underscore & reverse
}  dim, underscore, reverse & blank
~  dim, underscore, reverse & blink

>If not, does anyone know how to extract such info from a terminfo file?

You could decompile the terminfo entry or use the tput program.  I'll
describe the latter because I've just typed all this and I'm getting
tired.

By default, tput assumes that you are using the terminal type specified
by the TERM variable.  If you want to override the value of the TERM
variable, use the -T option:

$ tput -Twyse60 ...and so on...

In general, you simply feed tput the name of the terminal attribute
you want to know about.  To output the terminal's "is3" (init string
#3) capability:

$ tput is3

This output can be stored in a variable as such:

$ INITSTRING3=`tput is3`

(note those are backticks or backward single quotes)

>I can't seem to find a termcap entry that includes the required info

Not suprising since the majority of termcap and terminfo definitions
are substandard and incomplete with regard to features that aren't
used very often (such as writing in the status line or using special
keys).  Even the definition in the "termcap & terminfo" book listed as
a complete Wyse-50 entry is not complete.

Even with that shortcoming, I highly recommend the book since it
provides such enlightenment in termcap and terminfo creation and
editing areas.

Usually I wouldn't quote all that, but my hint is relevant to it all.  I'll
give you (and the rest of the readership of this newsgroup) a hack that will
fix the following problems:

1. flashing when turning on characteristics,
2. the surrounding "magic cookie" character at either side of the effected
   string and
3. 100% compatibility with properly written programs.

Solutions:

1. Speed up the I/O rate to 38.4 kbps.  The flash is still there, but it's
   so quick it becomes less annoying.

   WARNING: What follows is an ugly hack and should not be counted on or
   distributed as a properly-written termcap or terminfo file for the
   Wyse-50.

2. Instead of using the proper attributes for standout do this:

   a) go to the config menu and find the choice that lets you display
      "protected" chars another way.  Select the way you prefer best.
   b) save the config.
   c) use protected chars for standout_on and standout_off (I think
      they're ESC-& and ESC-', but I'm doing this from memory, so don't
      quote me)
   d) be sure to redefine the clear sequence to clear to spaces (NOT
      clear to protected spaces, else that will make your screen clear
      to a reverse video screen).

3. Set the standout glitch factor to 0 since protected chars is an
   embedded characteristic on a Wyse-50.

I've tried this and it works fine, but it's not perfect since
protected chars are actually used for something other than this in
other apps and this causes you to lose a valuable characteristic.

I believe that the magic cookie way of storing characteristics was
done because RAM was so expensive and it was cheaper to store the
characteristic in the same memory address as a character.

This sounds more like the Pine and lynx software is broken more than
the termcap.  Most programs (even modern ones written recently) don't
bother checking on or using intelligent screen data placement
algorithms with terminals that don't have embedded attributes.  [See
references on "sg" and "glitch" for details.]

Most likely the same problem as above.

Well, there you're in a bit of a jam.  There is no such thing as a
perfect Wyse-50 termcap entry unless you're using GNU termcap (which
allows arbitrarily long termcap entries).  BSD 4.3's termcap simply
doesn't allow the termcap entry to be long enough to properly describe
the Wyse-50.  Using terminfo, on the other hand, is quite adequate
since (like GNU's termcap) it too allows arbitrarily long database
entries.

>Please respond via email if possible...

I think on a group of this low content it is not too much to ask to
come back here to get your response.  Also, for every person that asks
a question there is another that wanted to ask but didn't or won't
have to because the question has already been answered.

Since you didn't specify what termcap you're using, I'll give you the
shorter one, the one that should work on all termcap-based systems
(GNU or otherwise).  I strongly urge you to use terminfo if at all
possible, however.  The switch will be well worth your while.

WY99GT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


Directions to change firmware in the 99GT display terminal:

1.      Unplug the power cord from the terminal and turn the rear of the
        terminal toward you (see illustration).

2.      Remove the 2 logic board screws from the rear panel.

3.      Slide the logic board out until two firmware ICs are exposed (it is not
        necessary to slide the logic board out the entire way).

4.      Using a small flat blade screwdriver, carefully pry out present
        firmware in locations 3D and 11D.

o       Be careful when positioning the screwdriver as not to damage the IC
        socket.

5.      Install new firmware:

o       P/N 250624-01 program in location 3D.

o       P/N 250622-01 graphics in location 11D.

   Note:  Be sure notch on the chip is going the same direction as the
          other chips.

               View from Component Side of Board


o       Verify that the IC direction is correct.  The "notch" on the end of the
        chip should be positioned towards the front of the logic board (look
        at the other IC's on the board, they are all pointing toward the
        front, too).

o       Watch to see that all the IC pins push into the socket and do not
        bend over.

6.      Slide the logic board back into the unit; fasten the logic board screws.

7.      Hook up keyboard and power connections


WY99GT "G-Key" RESET INSTRUCTIONS


Please be sure to reset the terminal after installation of firmware chips as
follows:

1.      Turn the terminal off, and remove the cabling from the Auxiliary and
        Modem ports.

2.      Hold down the "G" key on the terminal keyboard while booting up.  (You
        must keep holding the "G" key down throughout the power up sequence).

3.      Wait for the terminal to finish its screen diagnostic during the power
        up sequence.  You can tell when this is over when you see that the
        screen stops flashing.  The status line may appear after a few seconds.

4.      Release the "G" key and go into setup:  (Shift-SetUp.) or (Shift-Select)
        or (F4).

5.      Default all setup parameters by highlighting "DEFAULT ALL":
        (Enter the right arrow key three times) and then the F10 key.
        (Enter F10 again to EXIT or you may change the terminal settings at
        this time.

        Occasionally the terminal's personality parameter will "disappear".
        Repeating step 5 several times should correct this.


      * The key sequence to get into SETUP will vary depending on the keyboard
        type.

PRODUCT:           WY-85 WY-185

THE ISSUE:
        Arrow keys are not compatible.

OVERVIEW:
        There is a functional difference between the arrow keys on
        the WY-85 terminal and the WY-185 terminals. The differences
        are detailed as follows:

        Arrow Key               WY-85    WY-185
        ---------------------------------------
        <Up Arrow>  Book Says   Esc[A    Esc[A
                    Actual Code EscA     Esc[A

        <Dn Arrow>  Book Says   Esc[B    Esc[B
                    Actual Code EscB     Esc[B

        <Rt Arrow>  Book Says   Esc[C    Esc[C
                    Actual Code EscC     Esc[C

        <LftArrow>  Book Says   Esc[D    Esc[D
                    Actual Code EscD     Esc[D
        ---------------------------------------

        Notice that the WY-185 terminal produces the CORRECT code. The
        WY-85 omits the "[" . Differences include all personalities,
        except VT-52, and it doesn't matter whether you have 7 or 8
        bits selected.

RESOLUTION:
        The solution for this problem will have to be a software
        solution, since the WY-185 terminal does the codes correctly,
        there will not be a hardware fix for this. One solution for
        UNIX/XENIX systems would be to change the termcap definitions
        to reflect the correct codes. Applications which are written
        for the WY-85 terminals will require modifications to the
        applications to work correctly.

There are two (major) types of attributes used in terminals -- character
and embedded.

Your terminal is using embedded attributes.  These are special non-
displaying characters which tell the display driver to begin doing a
particular attribute following a screen location, until another
attribute character is encountered.  Since they take up screen memory,
they have to take up display space, and are usually rendered as a blank.
These attributes have the advantages that they can turn on and off
blocks of attributes in a single operation (just overstrike the
attribute location) and make the terminal cheaper to build.

The other type, used by VT100-type terminals, are character attributes,
which can be thought of as "wide" characters, where each screen position
has extra bits to describe the attributes for each individual character.
These have the advantage that you don't have to waste a screen position
to change attributes, but require you to overstrike all of the
characters in a string to reset the attributes and require more memory.

If you have a VT emulation mode on that beast, use <ESC>[<param>m to set
the character attributes.

(If you're trying to do 3270 emulation, embedded attributes are exactly
what you want, anyway, since the 3270 uses that type.)

  The "space" is probably an embedded attribute.  This means that the
  terminal is interpreting the data stored in the "space" as attribute
  data.  The attribute data applies to the characters following it.
  Deleting the "space" removes the attribute data.

  Embedded attributes is a trick for conserving memory.  It came from
  a time when memory was "expensive" and tricks were needed to add
  features without adding to hardware cost.  Non-embedded attributes
  use additional memory to record attributes.  Although these scheme
  no longer has a significant impact on hardware cost, it is necessary
  to implement it in followon products for backwards compatibility.

  Embedded attributes are found in WY50 and a few other early terminals.
  VT family products (VT100/200/300/400/500) use non-embedded attributes.
  VT510/20/25 models implement embedded attributes in ASCII emulations.

Well, I got great response to my request for a wy60 termcap entry.  So 
thanx to all!  The best response though was, since I had a terminfo entry
on my SYSV box, the infocmp command has a -C option that will dump the
termcap entry from the terminfo lib.  So, I guess it was another case
of RTFM.  Anyway, thanx much, I've got the wy60 entry added and it seems
to be working great.

Some Wyse terminals will allow the cursor and other non-alpha-numeric
keys to be redefined through the setup facility. An example of one of
these is the Wyse 30. However, the Wyse 50, (a supposedly superior
terminal), doesn't have this capability.

Wyse terminals generally don't have the model number printed in any
visible area on the front, but if you look for a silver-colored sticker
on the back panel of the monitor housing. Somewhere on it, in fine
print, you should see a designation for the model number. With the model
number in hand, there is a better chance that someone here can tell you
exactly what needs to be done, if this is possible on your Wyse model.

That's a better deal than most places would charge.

They go for about $150 - when sold with a 30 to 90 day guarantee.

On the Wyse terminals, I have used a place called Automated Systems in
Lincoln, Nebraska.  Flat rate $75 repair on wyse 50's.  If it's only a
board problem, they do board repairs for a flat $50.   Lots of places
do this - and it's only a 5 minute (or less) job to pull the board from
a 50.  (don't have their number handy, but you might call 1-800
information for it)

Horse Hockey.  A brand new MPS board (upon which the flyback is resident)
will cost under $120 and takes about 10 to 15 minutes to install and
adjust with a voltmeter.  As long as your logic board is OK, said MPS board
ought to last you at LEAST 3 years not counting lightning strikes.  :-)

>including labor.

	If they're going to charge you $75 and up to replace a flyback
and labor, you're getting charged about 12 to 15 bucks for the flyback
if they are getting them through the wyse-authorized parts centers.
A good technician can replace this flyback in about 15 minutes.
So if the charge is $75 and the flyback costs you $15, you're paying a
$60 labor charge for 15 minutes of work, or approx. $240 per hour!

>Can anyone tell me what the terminal would be worth once repaired?

	Given the above, if you get only the flyback replaced and the
terminal is more than 3 years old, I wouldn't give you 10 bucks for it.

        Unfortunately the WYSE50 has an annoying tendancy to blow up
MPS boards at anywhere between 3 1/2 years and 5 years of age.  A
"repaired" MPS board can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 6 months
from what we've seen here.

	We have had a hard time finding a depot that WILL repair them,
and warranty is either short or nonexistant in these cases.

	On the other hand, a good used wyse (that is, good logic board
and good keybaord) with a brand new MPS board should bring you
a fair piece of change providing you show the prospective buyer a
receipt or other means of proving the board is new.

	We have nearly 300 WYSEs, mostly 50's in our organization.  They
all fail in annoyingly identical and predictable ways.  If you buy the
new MPS board, the biggest favor you can do yourself is to have
your technician REMOVE C206 and replace it with a Nichicon HA series
UHA1H4R7KRA capacitor, 4.7 microfarads at 50 volts non-polarized.

	This capacitor can handle around 7 AMPS of ripple current, and
at high temperatures to boot.  C206 failures on the MPS board are one
of the biggest killers of WYSE50 terminals that WE have seen.

	If you cannot find a local vendor for this capacitor, try
Jacques Ebert Associates in Locust Valley NY.  You will pay several bucks
for this capacitor, but we have not seen a single one fail YET after
around 2 years of installing them.  That beats the pants off of anything
else we've tried, some of which don't last 3 weeks.  The key is the
spec on ripple current.

A good source for Wyse terminal repair is

    Intelogic Trace
    981 Isom Road
    San Antonio, Texas 78216
    1-800-929-8448

You have to call first for an RMA number before you ship the terminal
(800-929-8448).  Their standard price to fix just about anything is
$125, and about $200 if they have to replace the tube.  Their turnaround
time is about 2-3 weeks.  I've been using them for 4 years, and the
only problem I've had is once they sent me a terminal belonging to
someone else.  They immediately sorted it out and got me mine back and
had the other one picked up at their expense.  "A satisfied customer."

Hi Gregory,

Sounds just the sort of thing the terminal was made for. All data normally
goes to the modem port and can be copied to the aux port. 
There appears (I have not tried this but am reading from the users guide)
to be two ways to do what you want.

1) Press PRINT PAGE button. This sends the screen's contents to the printer
attached to the AUX port. The data is formatted exactly as shown on the 
screen.
(Pressed with the SHIFT key, it sends formatted data to the screen.)

  Press COPY PRT button. Turns copy print mode on/off. (Sometimes called
extension/auxiliary mode.) Pressed with the SHIFT key, it turns transparent
print mode on/off.

2) ESC L or ESC p prints an unformatted page.
   CTRL R turns copy print mode on 
   CTRL T turns all print modes off
   CTRL X turns transparent print mode on (enhance mode must be on)

Hope this helps.
If you want a photocopy of all the setup and control stuff then give me your
postal address and I will send it to you.

Cheers, Peter

Subject: Tips on fixing Wyse 60 terminals

I own a few of those and thought I should share what I learnt about how
to fix them by now.  Someone else posted a few other hints some time
ago, perhaps we could merge our knowledge.  The usual warnings apply: It
worked for me, but I give no warranty on any advice at all.  Be careful
or you or your terminal may get seriously hurt! High voltage is nothing 
to mess with.

Too dark letters
----------------
The variable resistors VR 202 and VR 401 control base brightness and
dark/bright ratio.  They are tiny white ones, and have the number
written just next to them.  DO NOT CHANGE THE BIGGER BLACK VARIABLE
RESISTOR! A friend of mine did and he has a terminal less now.

Different character height in different lines
---------------------------------------------
The variable resistors VR 302 and VR 303 can be readjusted to fix that.
You may have to try a little for best results.  They are also tiny white
ones, just looking like VR 202 and VR 401.

The display is not straight
---------------------------
This is a little difficult to fix, because you can make things worse
very easy.  Don't say I would not have warned you.  Around the display
tube are small square magnets.  By turning them a little, you can fix
the above problem, sometimes to be again perfect, other times only to
be at least acceptable.  If the pixels do not appear clear at a certain
location (say the upper middle of the screen), then this may help as
well.  It takes some time to change this, though.

Flaky display
-------------
I had the display change its shape out of a sudden or disappear at all.
Hitting the terminal :) fixed it for a while, but eventually it got
pretty bad.  The reason was a capacitor which pins were not bent down
on the soldering side before soldering.  The plastic material which is
fixed on the soldering side of the board bent it down, and broke the
soldering spot a little.  Resoldering it fixed all trouble.  The
soldering quality of the PCB seems rather moderate to me, so probably
there are other people who have terminals with bad soldering spots,
too.

I have a few wyse 60 with German keyboards, but they have no funct key
and the del key works fine.  NB: If someone needs German wyse 60
keyboards, I have a few spare ones which I would sell _really_ cheap.

In wyse 60 personality, you can use ESC c hhmm to set the clock.  Other
than that, just switch on the terminal at 8 am.  :) I don't know why
they did not use a RTC.

labels I don't know off hand either, although I guess it are soft
labels.  Wyse Word is nice, press control-capslock to start it.  Btw,
the calculator has no scientific notation and the calendar lacks the
julian calendar correction, but it is nice else and needs no
description to be used.

My terminals do not offer RTS/CTS handshaking and even 19200 baud is
flaky if you have a fast machine which sends as much as possible.  9600
never gave me trouble.

I had that happen, too.  After looking around for ages, it turned out
that the plastic cover mounted on the soldering side of the pcb was
fixed that hard, that it broke a soldering spot.  Resoldering it fixed
it, but you need to look very well for it.  The wire on that spot was
bent down some when the plastic/shielding cover was fixed at the pcb.  I
would not wonder if more terminals have that problem.  Try hitting the
terminal, that helped me for a while until one day when it decided to
have been hit and cursed at enough, then later I found that soldering
spot.  I have heard of other hardware problems in this group, although
most related to the wyse 50, which is commonly called a self-nuking
device.  ;-)

I noticed my terminals have different firmware releases, so their menues
and features differ some; don't wonder if someone tells you a menue
choice not offered by your model.  You may readjust the tiny white VRs,
but DO NOT MESS WITH THE BIGGER BLACK ONE.  We lost a terminal that
way, at least we think it was related to that.  Nobody wanted to try it
on a second terminal.

I don't have a wyse manual, but a televideo manual and the model in
question can emulate a wyse 60, so I can tell you escape sequences if
needed.  Unfortunately, this does not tell me the wyse-specific
sequences by which I can reach functions like setting the clock in
vt100 mode.  Btw, it is not a true vt100 emulation: It supports various
functions offered by vt220.  I use a vt220 termcap entry which works
fine.

Hold down the left shift key, then press the enter key on the numeric keypad.
If that doesn't work, then it's control-left shift, and the enter key.

If that doesn't work, call me sloppy and slap me silly -- let me know and
I'll figure it out.

You could, in a private termcap or terminfo entry, but you shouldn't
redefine the wyse50's backspace because it is *really* your terminal
settings or your Link MC2's Wyse50 emulation that is broken.

First, I'd try checking your stty settings and make sure you have
destructive backspaces turned on.  "stty echoe" or "stty crterase"
would be a good place to start, but check the man pages on your system
to be sure.

If that fails, I'd check your wyse50 termcap or terminfo entry (you
don't say which you're using) to make sure it's set correctly ("bc=^H"
should be in there, and bc= shouldn't be redefined to anything else in
the entry, I've included a good [but not 100% complete due to space
limits in BSD termcap] wyse50 termcap entry in another post on
comp.terminals.  Check for my name in other posts).  You could use the
include other entry option redefining only bc=, check the manpage for
termcap or terminfo for details on this.  If you've got the manual for
your terminal, you'd be 200% better off creating a whole new entry for
the native mode (don't use emulations of other terminals!).  Get a
copy of "termcap & terminfo" from O'Reilly & Associates.

Lastly, and only in a private termcap/terminfo entry or one that is
suitably marked as being LinkMC2's emulation of a Wyse50 (do *not*
redefine the real wyse50 entry), you could set bc= to "^H ^H" (careful,
there's a space in there).  This is incredibly ugly and improper and
will probably break other things, but it should work for the Unix
shell.  The only reason I mention this is to be complete in answering
your question, but I urge you to investigate stty options first.
Doing this is not only more hassle, but risky for all the other users
on your system that use this termcap or terminfo entry that DON'T want
destructive backspaces.

That's good to hear!

Actually, I had a long talk with Ray at Wyse Tech Support about keyboard
mapping. The issues with the VT100 mapping are that some of the keypad keys
are remapped to PF keys, and some of the function keys are mapped/remapped
in some way. This was of no concern to us since we don't use those keys
anyway, on our Unix system. Our biggest worries were getting the ESC, 
CTRL, and " ~ " keys in familiar places.

If the vt100 emulation works with Emacs, Pine, Elm, and lynx, with 
correct cursor movement and screen re-drawing, we'll be happy.

thanks, Betsy

Actually, they use the same large DIN connectors as old Wyse terminals. I 
see them in many places (public library) and the dimensions are the same.

A normal PC keyboard definately does NOT work. It's a loaded 10-pin DIN 
and about 1 or 2mm larger than a PC 6-pin DIN connector.

:-(  Looks like I'm out of luck.

If you have the old DIN connector, the only way is to get a old Wyse 
keyboard. The key signal between the RJ-11 style, PC style and the old 
Wyse DIN are all different. (I know, I use to work at Wyse).

First try hitting the "Select" key in upper right corner, if that
doesn't work try shift-Select

> 2) if there is no setup mode, how do you set the beast to half-duplex?

In setup mode screen, hit F4 for Comm, then arrow down to "Comm ="
field and press the space bar till you get "Comm = HDX".

Then hit F12, then space to toggle "save" to "yes" and hit
F12 again.

Good luck

Thanks for the tip - I got the same one from somebody via e-mail. However, 
I just talked to a guy from Olivetti, and he told me, thak while most
parts were built by Wyse (Wyse 120 is the one he mentioned), the keyboard
used a proprietory chip, making it impossible to use the Wyse keyboard.
He also told me that he sold the last one he had about 2 month back :<

Anybody care to send me a leftover keyboard ? :*{

Link PCST/G! haven't heard that term for a long time - I am one of the 
original designers.

Here is the bad news, you need to find a OLD Link keyboard, new Link's
keyboard have a different design (WYSE) and will not work. Try to find
a keyboard for the following LINK model: MC3, L125 or L220.

Link is now part of Wyse Technology, I believe their old 800 number still 
work (1-800-HIT-LINKS). As for Alloy, last time I heard they are in very 
bad shape and may be a goner by this time (??)

The old keyboard is kind of expensive: $70 - $100 US each, if you buy it 
new from Wyse/Link.

Good Luck.

   A lot depends on which keyboard you have. If you have the new keyboard,
with 16 function keys, hitting shift-Setup will get you into setup. 

  On the PC101 keybaord, use shift-Select (upper right corner).

  If you have the old AT keyboard, which is really small and nifty, I think
it's shift-control-tab or something. You probably want to get a new keyboard
if you have the AT-style one, becuase the WY60 cannot do VT emulation with that
keybaord. 
 
If you have more specific questions, or my answer wasn't clear, feel free to
mail me.

Type of terminal is shown on a plate either on the top of the base
(Wyse 50's) or back of the cover (Wyse 60's and newer Wyse 50's).
Sounds like the monitor/power supply  (MPS) board has croaked.

There are plenty of repair services around that will fix those kind of
boards for less than $65 (some around $40).  You'll have to pay for
freight to get it there and maybe back, too.

Call me--we sell Wyse terminals new and used, but I often refer people
to repair places close to where they are, to minimize the freight.

e-mail didn't work.

Depends on the type of keyboard.  Try either (simultaneously) Shift-Setup 
or  Shift-Setup-SysReq, or Shift-Select.

You'll get a series of menus, starting with the top setup, a directory to
the other ones.  Function keys  will
get you through that, then arrow keys.  To get out of where you are, use
F10, then right arrow to Save All, then F10 again, so you
don't have to do it after powering off and on.

Speak to Chris, Rose, or David K. at tech support.  They know that
terminal cold.  And, they're great.

> A) Reset terminal to factory defaults.

Get to the Setup menu by simultaneously pressing Shift-Setup.

Within the setup menu, push the letter "D" (for default), "S" (Save),
then "E" (exit) to fully implement the factory settings.  Then, go
back into setup and configure the terminal how you want it.  If
something strange still occurs, turn the terminal off for 10 seconds,
hold down the letter "G" while you power it back on and release it
when you see the cursor, then default the terminal.  On some of the
newer terminals, this procedure re-initializes a PROM within.

> B) Reset the arrow keys to defaults.

If you did A) above, then change the emulation, you'll need to push the
letter "F" which causes all screen attributes, c ursor and function key
default values to be loaded for that emulation.

> C) Program the function keys via setup mode

I don't believe you can do it.

> D) Program the function keys via ESC sequences

To program cursor and function keys, enter the following code in the exact
sequence:
 
   SHIFT   ESC |  p1  p2  "message" CTRL Y
 
The vertical-bar character after the ESCape key is like a colon but is
[one vertical line or perhaps two] (my keyboard doesn't have it).  p1
is the "value" number of the key you want to program,

                                    p1 value codes:

John, your terminal is running the "PC Terminal"
mode, whereby it does exactly as you said: it will
take in ASCII and ANSI information to display to
the screen, and when you press a key on the
keyboard, you will get the PC scan code for that
key. Best bet is to use the native mode (WY-60
mode), as it is a   known standard, and termcaps
are often included.

Most terminals (the Wyse 60 included) that are 
manufactured for international use can be converted 
by opening the case, locating the jumper that 
selects the voltage, and moving it from 240 to 120. 
The jumper in question has a large plastic handle 
that usually colored grey, or sometimes white or 
translucent plastic. Make sure that you also put 
the appropriate line fuse in for the voltage you 
are running at (ie: if the fuse was 1 ampere, when 
configured for 240 volts, you will probably need to 
replace the line fuse with a 2 ampere since the 
current draw will usually double). Best bet is to 
follow the manufacturer's instructions and if you 
are not sure about working on this, take it to a 
qualified technician.

We use a bunch of wy150s, which use almost exactly the same termcap as
the wy120.  Both of them have a wy50 mode which is very serviceable
EXCEPT for the stupid wyse arrow key usage (arrows send a single control
character rather than a unique sequence).

Depending on your flavor of Unix, you should see if there's a wy60ak or
wy120ak definition, which uses the Wyse native mode, but VT-style arrow
keys.  I use a slightly hacked wy120ak for everything, including
WordPerfect 5.1 for SCO Unix.  If you'd like a copy of this, email me.

Watch this one--many Wyse 50's do not correctly support flow control

By choice I would use a Wyse 60, but maybe they've fixed the firmware

We supply a fair number of terminals for various Unix multiuser
applications, and we have found that configuring terminals for screen
saver or "powersaver" mode is generally preferable to turning them off
and on--on a daily basis.  They simply seem to last longer when
avoiding the shock of powering on.

Wyse terminals, in particular, seem to benefit greatly from leaving
them on; they seem to burn out the most of the 5 or 6 brands we sell.

I repaired a few Wyse 60 terminals, and, from what I saw,
they are broken by design.

Personally, I always found screws that hold a cover are fixed in a way
that soldering spots have to break.  Other people complained about
capacitors which have to be replaced with better ones.  I don't think
the customer's site is the problem.  The terminals are.

I have 6 Wyse 60 terminals that are dead also. Most of these were

the problem continues.

$130 vs. $25, Thats why I keep saying try Anzio. I de-installed

I'm not familiar with the Wyse-320 terminal.  Do you mean Wyse-370?

I doubt that you will find a free implementation of a terminal of this
complexity.

Kermit-95 provides an emulation of the Wyse-370 minus the 64K color
palettes.  For info look at http://www.kermit-project.org/k95.html

    The problem is that Wyse50 and similar terminals are *very*
different in style from the VT100 series.  I have always mentally
divided terminals into two groups:  'hardware' and 'software'.

  Wyse-50 and Prestel belong to the 'hardware' group, and VT100 and
friends to the 'software' group.

   In the hardware group  screen effects are done almost totally with
the hardware.  As an example, if you set the highlight bit on
*highlight is now on until the end of the screen, or the place where
it is set off, whichever comes first*.  This is a *totally* different
concept from the VT100, where, after putting highlight on, it is on ONLY
for characters subsequently *written* until switched off.

  Unix does not really understand such an idea, and termcap and
terminfo merely hack at it a bit, which is why the book is not
particularly useful on its own.

  You also have to deal with the tiresome 'cookie-glitch'; a product
of limited hardware capabilities of the day.  [early 1980s]

  Regards,
        Harry  (who has written a Wyse50 emulator).

This is the first time I have ever heard it described quite like that.

I look at it from two different perspectives.  There are text
terminals which are based on the ANSI X3.64-1979 standard (replaced by
ISO-6429) upon which most modern day terminals are based (VT100 and
higher; SCOANSI; AT386; IBM LFT,HFT,AIXTERM; SNI; WY350 family; and
most Unix consoles) and those that are not based on this standard
(VT52; Wyse 30,50,60, and their decendents; HP; TVI; DG; IBM 31xx;
and many others).

The other dimension is defined by how are attributes implemented.
They can either be VISIBLE or HIDDEN and applicable to the following
CHARACTER, LINE or PAGE.  A VISIBLE atteibute tkaes up a character
position whereas a INVISIBLE one does not.  Some terminals allow any
of the six possible combinations to be used.  Others limit you to just
one.

ANSI X3.64 terminals always use HIDDEN/CHARACTER attributes and the 
Wyse 50 uses VISIBLE/PAGE attributes.  The Wyse 60 for example defaults
to INVISIBLE/PAGE attributes but can be configured either locally or 
remotely to use CHARACTER or LINE attributes instead.

---

When developing terminal emulators always have two things:

 *  copies of the manufacturer's manuals

 *  a real terminal 

The manual will give you a feeling for what the escape sequences are
and what they are supposed to do.

For an ANSI X3.64-1979 or ISO-6429-based terminal, you can implement a
very simple parser that will work regardless of the things you do not
know.  Command sequences that you do not recognize will be absorbed
and ignored, if you do it right.

Non-ANSI-X3.64 terminals are not that forgiving.  They are unparsable
and, unless you know all of the sequences that the terminal accepts,
the visual appearance of the data will be corrupted by unprocessed
escape sequences.

The real terminal is necessary so you can test the behavior of the 
terminal against your implementation and so that you determine all
of the undocumented behaviors that the terminal provides.

I agree with Harry that implementing a good emulator, even for simple 
terminals such as VT100 and WY50, is a non-trivial piece of work. 
Unless you are doing it as a hobby or because there is no other piece 
of software available that can perform the job that you need, it is
significantly cheaper to just buy an emulator from someone else.

Extremely good emulators can be had for a few dollars a copy in
quantity and if the quantity is small the overall cost must be less
than the cost of your time.  See

   This is a slightly different classification. For my purpose as a
developer my classification is more useful in determining how hard an
emulation is to do.  This is because to do a 'hardware' terminal is
*much* harder than a 'software' one.  It also tends to be slower, as
you have to 'extend' the attribute forwards.

  Note that while VT52 may not be a 'standard based' terminal it is,
in my classification, a 'software' terminal, and thus not so hard to
do.

If you go into the Wyse Setup program (probably on F3), there should
be an option to turn the break key off.  You'll have to remember to
turn it on again though when you need it.

To be quite honest, if you've got servers in an environment where
somebody is liable to put mail on their consoles, then you're doing
something wrong--servers should be locked away so only you and your
assistants can get at them!

Wyse terminals have about a half dozen different keyboard styles,
depending on the model of terminal.  Unfortunately, most vendors do not
let you know which one they will ship you unless you specify the exact
model that you want.  If your supplier will swap, then choose a keyboard
layout that best fits your application.

Three different layouts are shown on:

    http://www.wyse.com/terminal/

Also, your Wyse manuals should list the keyboard layouts that are
available for whatever model of terminal that you have.

That is really interesting considering the fact that PCTERM is not an
emulation but a keyboard mode that may be applied to any terminal 
emulation.

Kermit 95 <http://www.kermit-project.org/k95.html> supports a Wyse 60
emulation that has all of the Wyse 150 extensions.  And it supports
PCTERM keyboard mode.

{ Actually Link and Altos terminals are the only other ones
  I saw that emulated Wyse-150 "PC Term" mode correctly --
  what a hoot to see this still around...                   }

As I posted in a previous post, try Procomm Plus for Windows.  Then set the
emulation to "PC Scan Codes" under the ANSI modes.  What the Wy-150 in PC-
Term mode is doing is sending back 8-bit codes per key that emulate the
scancodes of the original IBM PC/XT keyboard and upon return, is acting like
you have ANSI.COM running.

{ Don't laugh! This was perfect for those folks with Alloy boards that where
  an XT or AT on a card, and used a serial terminal in PC-Term mode as the
  screen and keyboard.  A Wyse-99GT would even provide HGA graphics emulation
  with these boards (the Hercules graphics mode) }

I am note sure but from it sounds like a U-19 chip problem.
the normal symptoms are: vertical lines on screen, chracters
missing pixels, "snow" all over screen.  wyse claimed that
only a few wyse60 (in the early '90's) were affected so i
thought we had all of them :).
the problem is that wyse "cold soldered" the chips
onto the boards. these heat up over time deteriorate.  the u-19
chip is for video display.  to fix it, one just needs to apply
solder to the -19 chip.  while the case is off, one might want
to brighten the display.  they come so dim from the factory (re-
gardless of the dimmer slide setting).

the wyse-60 basically has two keyboards: ascii and pc-101. the
ascii has 16 function keys across the top and the pc-101 has
12 function keys.  the pc-101 is just that.  a standard pc
keyboard with an rj-11 jack (instead of the regular din connector).
there are other styles available such as dec compatible though
rare.  also custom configurations were available as well.  the

   Interesting.  My Wyse-60 books make no mention of a clock, nor have

Ya, you can set the clock through the <CTRL-CAPS> WyseWorks tools.  
You will discover that the clock resets at loss of power (to 8:00). Simple
solution:  turn it on at 8AM everyday. :)

If you want to kill the clock on the status line... enter setup
(on mine it is <SHFT-SETUP>), hit F1, and toggle the status line value.
'Extended' keeps the mode indicator and kills the clock and cursor pos.

I have no manual for this one and have learned what I know through
experimentation and FAQs.  If anyone has a manual that they would
be willing to photocopy, I would be most appreciative.

    My handbook says it transmits the 'DEL' character, and nothing
about it changing modes.  I don't remember having problems with using
it on a Wyse 60.  Are you sure that your host is not mis-interpreting
it?

Hi, Max,
 
There was one other choice for entering set-up, and that is with the ANSI
(20 function key) keyboard: shift -F3.  

What I would also suggest is entering set-up, depressing the "D"
(default), saving those settings ("S"), then exiting from set-up ("E"),
which will fully implement the factory settings.  Then, re-enter set-up,
make the changes that you need, and, as Mr. Shuford says, "S" to save, and
"E" to exit.  Long ago, Wyse and Link also suggested holding down the 'g'
key before powering the terminal on, until you see the 'g' on the display,
then default the terminal, then configure it as you need to.  Holding down
the 'g' re-loaded some other setting, but my memory fails me and I can't
tell you why they suggested this.

Subject: Re: Wyse Term

I'm not sure this helps but there is one escape sequence for
loading internally defined character sets:

  ESC @ <bank> <set>

  bank is 0 to 3
  Set is:
    @ - Native mode
    A - Multinational (CP437)
    B - Standard ASCII
    C - Graphics 1
    D - PC Equivalent
    E - Graphics 2
    F - Graphics 3
    G - Standard ANSI
    ` - 44-line native
    a - 44-line multinational
    b - 44-line PC
    c - 44-line Standard ASCII
    d - 44-line Standard ANSI

  where each set is 128 characters.

   @ is ASCII with line drawing in C0
   A is the upper half of CP437
   B is ASCII with control character descriptors in C0
   C,E,F are line drawing subsets
   D is the lower half of CP437 (PC Graphics in C0)
   G is ASCII with a different set of line drawing characters
        in the C0 range.

  ESC B <bank>   assigns the primary character set
  ESC C <bank>   assigns the secondary character set

The problem is that none of the above character sets contain 'oe' or 'ue'.

If you were using Kermit 95 as a Wyse 60 emulator you could configure
the client to use ISO-Latin1 to produce the characters you need but
unfortunately, ISO Latin1 is not supported by the Wyse terminals.

IIRC, press shift-setup and the setup option appear at the bottom; you
can scroll through the listings witht the up/down arrow keys and change
values with the spacebar. Look for one labeled "Keypad", and there
should be a "German" option.  Also, I believe you have to have the
appropriate ROM chip installed.

Sorry if this is obviious but you don't say what you've tried....

What does stty -a say?

Have a look at man stty (the bit you are looking for is about CS8) - of
course if you want the line initialized before you login you'll need to put
corresponding settings in your gettydefs file.....and that won't help with
console boot messages.

Oh. Okaaay... Right I've dug out the manual ...

It says nothing about iso-8859-1, shame that means most of the modern locale
stuff won't work directly. I does have IBM codepage 437 so you can display
some characters. It says the character set selection strings work in Native,
WY-50+ and ADM31 modes.

If your current terminfo for the wy60 is rubbish the one in Eric Raymond's
master terminfo is respectable; it's at:

   http://www.tuxedo.org/terminfo

If you want locale to work your best bet is probably to use GNU 'screen'
to do the translation. The uuencode data at the end of this message is
a line for the .screenrc that does ISO-8859-1 to CP437 translation.
for keyboard entry you'll have to define your favorite bindkey items.

In use you'll want to re-define the wy60's backspace key and probably
the arrow keys on the terminal itself. By default the left arrow and
backspace send the same character (^H) and the down arrow sends a ^J
which will be confused with a CR if the tty isn't in raw mode.

You can get lots of information on the wyse60 from the wyse website:

    http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/wyseterm.asp
   http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/KBmenu1.asp?Q=7
   http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/SEQwt.asp?Q=7
   http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/FAQwt.asp?Q=7

The cp437 upper characters are called 'multinational' by the wy60.
The FAQs also have wyse termcap and terminfo entries.

Have fun!

Subject: Wyse 75 terminal problems

I recently accquired a used (read abused) Wyse 75 terminal and
keyboard. The terminal was filthy when I got it, and I dusted it off
and plugged it in. It beeps, and seems to work just fine, the screen
is legible, and I can get into the setup and everything. The only
problem is that the screen is kinda messed up/wavy, and it makes an
annoying whineing/squealing noise. It also smells really bad after it
has been running for a few minutes. I popped the cover off the monitor
part, and it doesn't look like any caps have burst. Any ideas? What
could cause this sort of a problem? Thanks!

Subject: Re: Wyse 75 terminal problems

Just a guess, it sounds like the low voltage power supply is messed up.
Maybe the filter caps need replacing. Without a better description of
what wavy means it's a bit hard to be accurate. You may want to find out
what's getting overheated. Try the low voltage line transformer. I think
those terminals have one.  I am too lazy to take mine apart to find out.
I am thinking wavy means that there are one or two horizontal lines
slowly moving up the screen distorting the characters.

One other thing you might try is the horizontal oscillator may be off
frequency. There should be an adjust for that either in a coil or a pot
adjustment. I would do this as a last after you have checked for what's
overheating and causing the smell.  More than likely the oscillator
frequency will change with some percentage of change in the D.C. power
supply voltage. One method is to pull the D.C. power supply leads from
the rest of the circuit and see see if the transformer still heats up.
Meaning, separate the D.C. voltage generated at the power supply from
the circuit it powers.

In any case, you will need to check those power supply caps and the
diodes.. Hope you got a volt/ohm meter handy. If not go to radio shack
and get a cheap one. It will do the job you need done.

By the way, I have a Wyse 85 that I have been using for a few years.
It's quite reliable for my purposes and has a small footprint which
leaves plenty of space on the table it sits on. It's quiet as a
churchmouse although I have never heard a churchmouse....

I don't see in his posting any indication that the terminal was set to run
in vt100 mode.  (You seem to be assuming that he's confusing the numeric
keypad's "Enter" key with the return key).  The wy60 terminfo entry doesn't
contain smkx/rmkx.

Oh haven't you installed the ESP module yet ?  :-)

Seriously tho, I've used wy60's and wy120's and they are _very_ good
terminals but if they were running in native mode he would have been
having problems with the backspace key and the left and down arrow keys
not return. (BTW: Most Users are used to the PC keyboard under windows,
or the linux console, and think Enter and Return are synonyms)

IME on most unix machines (But never the linux console) the commonest
termcapinfo problems are:


1) Wrong TERM= setting.
   If possible an auto-detect is best but can only be reliable if all
   the terminals are one of a small set of types.

2) VT100 Klone function keys.
   ARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGG!!! ****! ****! ****! ****! ****! ****! ****!!!!
   I told a lie -- the linux console _is_ a culprit here!

   Nearly every terminal emulator has a vt100 klone emulation most of
   them agree on F1..F4 (Except Linux! and XTerm R5) but _none_ of them
   agree on the rest; and as for Shift Fkeys don't make me laugh!

3) VT100 Application keypad.
   This can be as evil as some termcaps having smkx and rmkx the wrong
   way around but the terminfo on the same machine is different. So one
   application will work until you use 'vi'. But just turning it on
   will effectivly disable the numeric keypad just when your 'User'
   wants to use it.

4) WY60 arrow keys.
   This is rare nowadays as it's much more likely that TERM= will be
   set wrongly.


Enough! I expect you know all this Thomas; for me it's an everyday
occurance, I was at a client's on Tuesday and they haven't even got
the 'stty' setting setup (let alone termcapinfo) on their HP-UX box.


"Is the caplock light turned off?"
"Press the colon key" -- "What's a colon."
"I can't find the 'any' key"
"The backslash is the key with a line from to left to bottom right"

I've been spoiled by xterm, which lets me reset the cursor- and keypad-modes
from the popup menu (it's been a long time since I had to tinker with the
setup mode in a serial terminal).  So I guess it is inconvenient when you
run into a program that doesn't treat smkx/rmkx properly (but it's probably
better to just fix the program).

Hello,

I have a WY-520ES which is connected to a Cisco 2500 series router. 
When booting the cisco, I need to send a 'break' sequence. 
I tried the list provided by cisco

None seems to work.
Any ideas?

It depends on which keyboard you use (ANSI or PC), see:

    http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/Keydetl1.asp?Q=27&R=4


  Extract:
  ---
  Cmd                                             ANSI    EPC
  Send break to host (for active session)         F5      Alt Pause
  ---

On my Wyse 520 with ANSI keyboard, the F1 to F5 keys did not have
special meanings until I enabled them in the setup menu.

With an ANSI keyboard, holding F3 while powering up the terminal
will bring you to the setup menu, from there follows the menu and
change the F5 key meaning to break. [You can change the meaning of
F3 to setup so that you can go into the setup at any time, not just
powerup.]

[I don't know what's the difference between an 520 and 520ES.]
[I don't know what's the difference between my 1994 unit and
 a 2002 one. Things could have get changed since then.]

Anyway, this is my Amber Wyse 520 terminal:

Subject: WYSE150   v.   ASCII line graphics

I can't seem to get any line graphics to display on a WYSE150es. (The
upper 128 through 255 ascii characters) We're running it in vt100 mode
off of Red Hat Linux 6.2.

Using the Anita terminal emulation program in Windows, I've gotten the
line graphics to display by setting the character set to "IBM PC
(OEM)". However, we still have terminals in use so I need to get them
to display the characters properly as well. Since the characters are
displayed properly in the emulator, I'm assuming that they are being
transmitted properly and all I need to do is find the appropriate
setting for the WYSE150 in vt100 mode.

This probably has something to do with character set selection, but
all the limited doumentation I've found on the web has got me no
where...

This could depend on the fidelity of the Wyse terminal's VT100 emulation. A 
real VT100 only accepts 7-bit characters (ie. it'll just ignore the top 
bit).

Subject: tuxedo.org's terminfo - no destructive backspace for WYSE50 or
    WYSE150 ?

We've got a WYSE 150es which needs to display ascii line graphics.
Instead of bashing my head against the vt100 workarouds for this,
we've decided to run the terminal in its native personality, wyse 150
or 150+. Unfortunately, the backspace key isn't functioning properly,
behaving simply as a left arrow. control-b does the same thing as
control-h or the left arrow key.

In fact, I haven't found a control sequence for a WYSE 150 that
actually does do a destructive backspace. I'm becoming more familiar
with the terminfo file but even the one found at tuxedo.org doesn't
have a functional backspace.

With the terminal set to emulate WYSE 150 or 150+ (actually the native
personality) and TERM=wy150  --- screen attributes like reverse video
don't work
With the terminal set to emulate WYSE 50 or 50+ and TERM=wy50 or wy150
-- line graphics come out as other characters
With the terminal set to emulate WYSE 150 or 150+ and TERM=wy50 --
screen attributes are ok!

All three of these scenarios fail to produce a destructive backspace.
However, running as a WYSE150+ with TERM=wy50 at least gets me the
line art and correct text display attributes. The other choice is to
run as a vt100 with TERM=vt100 and use no line graphics but with a
destructive backspace.

Does anyone out there have a destructive backspace on their WYSE150
with TERM=wy50 or wy150 or ?????

Unfortunately you don't say to what kind of system this Wyse 150-es
is attached, or what type of software application is communicating
with the terminal.
 
Putting on my Sherlock Holmes Detective Hat, I deduce from your
reference to a "terminfo" file that the host system has terminal
control of the type associated with System V Unix derivatives.

It would be a mild extrapolation to deduce that you have not read
the documentation for the "stty" command, as by typing "man stty".
Depending on the Unix flavor, other man pages of significance
might be ldterm, termio, and termios (as in the case of Solaris;
for other Unix implementations or for Linux, your mileage may vary).

Now, admittedly, man-page documentation is often useful only if you
already have an idea of what to look for.  If you'd like a kinder,
gentler introduction to the subject, I suggest you look here first:
    
    http://www.aplawrence.com/Unixart/terminals.html

and then follow up with resources listed at:
    
    http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html

Although not must use with most System V Unix products, the
following is useful for those with BSD-derived Unix systems:

A real VT100 does NOT do codepage 437.

In VT100 mode the Wy120 (the previous model) strips off the top bit ie it
ignores parity. In fact the wy120's emulation is so good that it even gets
the finer differences between the vt100 and the vt220 correct eg: NRC mode.

I don't think you will be able to do this in vt100 mode. If you're in
vt220 mode (assuming the wy150 has it) you can set the high bit characters
to ISO-8859-1 (or latin1) which is the character set that Windows cp1252
is based on. This way you'll have a for more standard high bit character
set for  and .

You can still access the real line drawing characters (the box corners
etc) by using the VT100 character set controls (if 'Anita' is any good
at all) by making sure that the TERM variable in Linux is vt100, vt220
or something similar.

If you get this right your next headache is function keys -- a real vt100
has _none_ ... though it does have four 'PF' keys.

If you can't access the characters you want in vt100 mode may have more
luck in native mode, but make sure the host knows it's talking to a wy150
not a vtklone. (TERM= variable) The wyse website has some documentation
on the terminals if you need to go past the basic terminfo.

BTW:
  I use ISO-8859-1 on all of wy120, Linux console, xterm and Windows
  terminal emulators (PuTTY, CRT etc). The wyse works fine (including
  boxes) in vt220 mode with a stock vt220 terminfo but the f-keys are
  mis-labeled so I use this instead:

vt220-120|Wyse120 in VT220 emulation mode,
      kf1=\EOP, kf2=\EOQ, kf3=\EOR, kf4=\EOS,                                         kf5=\E[M, kf6=\E[17~, kf7=\E[18~, kf8=\E[19~,

This is the main reason I don't like wyse native modes. The left arrow and
backspace both default to ^H. The normal workaround is to map one or the
other to some other sequence in the terminal then adjust the terminfo to
match. As down arrow (which is mapped to ^J) is also frequently a problem
I tended to remap the arrow keys. Once the arrow keys are out of the way

  stty erase ^H

will make the backspace destructive. Just to complete the problem the
function keys are also a little weird and occasionally give problems
as their sequences include ^A (which may get eaten) and ^M (which may
be translated to ^J)!

true (the reference to 128-255 sounds more like an emulator running on a PC)

Subject: Re: tuxedo.org's terminfo - no destructive backspace for WYSE50 or
    WYSE150 ?

Ok, getting closer. Thanks for the assistance.

I've used the setup screen on the WYSE150 to remap the left arrow key
to control-B. Pressing the left arrow key now produces ^B on the
screen. This can be deleted as a single character by pressing the
backspace key. Obviously the desired behavior is moving the cursor one
character to the left.

I assumed this behavior could be set in terminfo with the following
syntax:
kcub1=^B,
or (what's the diffence between these anyway)
cub1=^B,
However, hitting a control-B or the left arrow, which produces this
sequence, only puts ^B on the screen. The terminfo settings were
verified after running tic by looking at the output of infocmp and
they were in fact set. Next I tried typing: stty erase ^B to see what
would happen. Yet control-B still only displays ^B.

What am I missing?
(I've pasted the output from infocmp below)

These are the function keys in my vt220 terminfo.

   kf1=\EOP, kf2=\EOQ, kf3=\EOR, kf4=\EOS, kf5=\E[17~,
   kf6=\E[18~, kf7=\E[19~, kf8=\E[20~, kf9=\E[21~, kf10=\E[29~,

Hmmm, looking at the master it looks like I've got the 'vt220-old' version,
I still need to do the same with the new one though 'cause of F5.

man 5 terminfo

      key_backspace             kbs    kb   backspace key
      key_left                  kcub1  kl   left-arrow key
      cursor_left               cub1   le   move left one space

The ones that begin with 'k' are for the sequences sent by keys.
The ones without are sent by the application to move the cursor round the
screen, don't change these.

Make sure your compiled terminfo is actually used by your application
(eg: get rid of the standard one in /usr/share/terminfo/w while testing)

Note, command line utilities (cat!) don't normally use terminfo however
any that have been linked with the readline utility (eg: bash) will if
/etc/inputrc or ~/.inputrc have been setup (man readline).

If you're using readline (bash) you may want to setup the keys in 'emacs'
mode 'cause readline doesn't always obey terminfo properly:

In terminfo
   kcub1=^B, kcuf1=^F, kcuu1=^P, kcud1=^N,

and in bash
  set -o emacs

or in inputrc
  set editing-mode emacs

This is what you get it you are using bash in 'vi' mode, bash thinks it
knows best, other programs know better.

| Would a Wyse 60 keyboard work properly on a Wyse 150 terminal? 

From time to time, somebody pops up in "comp.terminals" and asks
if Wyse keyboards are interchangable between different models of
terminals made by Wyse.  Not having access to lots of different
Wyse models, I don't know if you can use a Wyse 60 keyboard with 
a 150.  And I'm not sure if you can extrapolate compatibility     
of that relatively older product from the characteristics of 
newer models. Perhaps you can try it and report back what happens?


| I'm planning on using this "combo" on Sun headless machines.
| Is there an equivalent to a Sun keyboard Stop-A?

Sun SPARC-based systems are designed to be configured headless (using
a character-cell console terminal communicating with the A serial port
at 9600,8,N,1 by default) while yet allowing operators to do this.   

Traditionally, the "Break" condition on the RS-232 serial line is
used to signal the OpenBoot PROM monitor to seize control from the
operating system, just as if you had typed Stop-A (or L1-A) on a  
directly attached Sun keyboard.

I think that Wyse terminals have a "Break" key that generates the
the RS-232 serial "Break" condition.  Press that key, or perhaps 
Control and Break together, and you should get the "ok" prompt.  

(The serial "Break" condition is a voltage level held for a certain
length of time; it is not an ASCII character. Also, it is not the  
same as Telnet's "break" signal, unless some terminal server
translates it so.)

A problem arises with serial Break:  voltage glitches from merely
unplugging the terminal's serial cable can *also* produce a serial
Break condition. Sometimes this has mystified system administrators,
not understanding why the machine suddenly dropped into PROM mode,  
suspending all other processing.  (They could recover from this, if
they knew to merely type "go" to the "ok" prompt quickly enough.)  

Therefore, Sun invented an "Alternate Break sequence" that can be
configured on the machine to avoid this voltage-glitch problem.  
By default, the Alternate Break sequence is a 3-character sequence:
Carriage Return, Tilde and Control-B [CR ~ CTRL-B].  For information
on how to set it up, read the following man pages from a recent
release of Solaris:  kbd, zs, se, asy.

An additional safety measure on all of Sun's newer enterprise-class
SPARC servers is a key switch on the frontpanel that enables or
disables the console-Break function.

the "system terminal setup" page of [this website] and see also

According to the WYSE keyboard/terminal cross-reference list, it should:

    http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/Keydetl1.asp?Q=18&R=3

Everything seems to be compatible with either all three of the 120/150/160,
or none of them.

If you're doing a serial console, sending a "break" should work.  Haven't
gotten my terminal to function well enough to confirm anything yet.

Subject: wyse60 function keys error

ok, ill do my best to explain my problem. My english is terrible,
sorry.

First of all, we have SCO server 5, with a custom application on
it..the pc client were connecting via serial ports to the server to
log in the application..everything worked fine until we decided to
install a NIC in the SCO server to be able to trash all those serial
cable..The NIC is properly installed, everyone can ping everyone. The
server is using wyse60 emulation protocol. I have downloaded a wyse60
client for windows, i can log in the server as usual, but the display
isnt the same as the old serial connection ..but that is not the
biggest problem, still workable..

The biggest problem is when the user needs to type any Function Keys
such as F8, etc..the server write some @G caracteres..Anyone know what
is the problem and how to resolve it ? Any help is appreciated..thank
you.

Regards

Fred

Subject: Re: wyse60 function keys error

The function key sequence returned by wyse60 on F8 is ^AG^M. Sounds like
your Wyse 60 client is sending those, but the server isn't seeing them as
the function key sequence.

Are you sure that your logins are getting TERM properly set to wyse60?
Easy way to check: log on to an account that will give you a shell (root
if you have to), type in "set", and look for the "TERM=" line. If it
isn't set to wyse60, there's your problem. If it is, then you have to
examine either your termcap or termlib (depending on your application,
you may even have a custom version of those) and see if the file agrees
on the definition of the function keys.

   [or printenv in csh]

Why would you look for something else?  That is that the arrow keys
of a Wyse 50 terminal send.

Those codes are the correct codes for the terminal to send to the
host, assuming that the host computer knows that it is supposed to
be talking to a Wyse 50.

In a full-duplex communication link (which is almost always what you
use with Unix), if the cursor moves around after you hit a key, it is
because the host computer sent something back to the terminal after it
detected the pressing of the arrow key.  The arrow key does NOT have a
direct link to the display screen.

It appears that you are not correctly informing the Unix host computer
which termcap entry to use.  

Look to your environment variable TERM and your shell variable "term".
(I don't know what your system does, but many Unixes automatically sync
these two....)

You may be interested to know that the helpful O'Reilly and Associates
book "termcap & terminfo" by Strang, Mui, and O'Reilly uses the Wyse
50 for most of its examples.  ISBN  0-937175-22-6  $22.00 (US).  It
contains good advice on this sort of problem.

If you want Wyse 50 mode, you don't want to do that.

Jetzt ist der Dienst (=Treiber) dem Betriebssystem bekannt. Mit den
Betriebsystemkommandos 'net start' und 'net stop' knnen Sie den Dienst
starten bzw. stoppen. Diese Kommandos beziehen sich immer auf den Namen des
Dienstes, nicht den Dateinamen des Treiberprogramms! Wenn der Name eines
Dienstes aus mehreren Wrtern besteht, mu er mit Anfhrungszeichen
eingegeben werden, siehe Beispiel:

net start "Wyse 120"
net stop "Wyse 120"

Der Dienst knnte bei Bedarf mit dem Kommando:

siar "Wyse 120" remove

wieder aus der REGISTRY-Tabelle des Betriebssystems entfernt werden.
Danach kann er nicht mehr gestartet werden.

Das Starten und Stoppen des Terminaldienstes kann natrlich auch alternativ
vom Desktop mit Hilfe des Control-Panels durchgefhrt werden.

Wichtiger Hinweis:

An dieser Stelle sei noch einmal darauf hingewiesen, da in der MediStar
Konfigurationsdatei "sysconf.s" der Name der Terminaltreiberdatei ohne
Extension ".EXE" fr den Eintrag

com2-1 = terminal(wyse120) task(0) ... usw.

verwendet werden mu (und NICHT der symbolische Name des Dienstes, wie in
unserem Beispiel "Wyse 120").

?Namen der Treiberprogramme:

Sounds like a problem with full intensity / half intensity -- one displays but
not the other.

If the half intensity doesn't display because of hardware issues (turned down
all the way or just plain "broken" at the the board level), I could conceive of
getting the results you just described.

Thanks,

We've been thinking about that, but we were planning to have all the
servers for this company hosted externally (similar to SunGard). 
Doing this will require we leave one server here to handle DHCP.  Wyse
has been ABSOLUTELY no help on this issue, so it looks like we'll have
to do it that way.

Subject: Re: DHCP failure Wyse term

Easy fix.  Chances are you need to enforce RFC 1048 style DHCP
responses or the Wyse terminals won't recognize the offer.  This is
true for most BOOTP devices I've encountered and some DHCP capable
devices.

With ISC's DHCP server you do this with the option: 

always-reply-rfc1048 on;

I don't know how to enforce this with a Cisco router; does anyone else?

Subject: wyse 60 software configuration

hi,

is it possible to configure a wyse 60 with software through the aux or
modem port instead of pressing shift select on the keyboard?

the scenario is, we have a wyse 60 with a 2d barcode reader.  every
now and again during scanning the personality changes from wy60 to
vt100.

According to the manual the following applies:

   Change to VT100 mode send...         ESC~;

I have never tried it, but am a mad collector of old terminal manuals
for just this type of need.  I hope it works.

I think that's it!

`~' is a field delimiter in our pdf417 barcodes.

TOPIC:  WY60 CODES NOT SUPPORTED IN WY150 WY160 WY325

DATE:   4-2-93

THE ISSUE:
        WY69 commands not supported on WY150 / 160 / 325.

OVERVIEW:
        WYSE Tech Support has encountered a few ESC codes from the
        original WY60 personality are not supported in the NATIVE
        or WY60 personalities on the WY150, WY160, or WY325. 

RESOLUTION:
        The following is the list of WY-60 native mode commands that
        are not supported in at least one Wyse product in the native
        or "WY-60" personality.   Commands that have additional
        parameters HAVE NOT been compared for completeness across the
        domain of terminals (except ESC G attr).

       CAVEAT:   NO CLAIM IS MADE AS TO THE COMPLETENESS OR ACCURACY 
       OF THIS DATA.  FURTHER, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE BEHAVIOR OF ANY
       ESCAPE SEQUENCE IS IDENTICAL IN ALL EMULATION INCARNATIONS.

Wyse documented a complete-reset procedure given for a different
model terminal.  I don't know if it would work, but you could try:

    http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/wits/13205.txt

WY99GT "G-Key" RESET INSTRUCTIONS

Please be sure to reset the terminal after installation of firmware chips as
follows:

1.  Turn the terminal off, and remove the cabling from the Auxiliary and
    Modem ports.

2.  Hold down the "G" key on the terminal keyboard while booting up.  (You
    must keep holding the "G" key down throughout the power up sequence). 
    
3.  Wait for the terminal to finish its screen diagnostic during the power
    up sequence.  You can tell when this is over when you see that the
    screen stops flashing.  The status line may appear after a few seconds.
    
4.  Release the "G" key and go into setup:  (Shift-SetUp.) or (Shift-Select)
    or (F4).

5.  Default all setup parameters by highlighting "DEFAULT ALL":
    (Enter the right arrow key three times) and then the F10 key.
    (Enter F10 again to EXIT or you may change the terminal settings at
    this time.
 
    Occasionally the terminal's personality parameter will "disappear".
    Repeating step 5 several times should correct this.

(The key sequence to get into SETUP will vary depending on the keyboard type.)

On the neck of the CRT tube you should see the yoke with some square
magnets glued to it.  Loosen them and turn each individual magnets to
get the best geometry for the display.


If the process does not improve the geometry you may have to change
the yoke. At least that's how it was done on a Wyse 60. I presume
it should be the same for the model 160.

Good luck.

Comments /Unixart/terminals.html
UnixartTerminals :

Well, it is the end of an era. After some 17 years of production, Wyse
Technology has retired the king of ASCII terminals, the venerable WY-60,
officially End-of-Life'd in November 2004.

The WY-60 is an all-time best seller, exceeding the sales of all of the
DEC VT models combined. I can't recall how many 60's I have installed
(and repaired) over the years, but it has to be in excess of a thousand
or so (one installation alone had over 30 of the suckers hooked up to a
SCO UNIX 3.2v4.2 box powered by a single 200 MHz AMD K6 -- it ran plenty
fast for the times). Even as Wyse developed newer models, the WY-60
continued to be the weapon of choice due to its features, easy-on-the-eyes
display, and reliability. In fact it was just before they EOLed the 60
that I sold one to a client who is still processing on terminals.

The funny thing is that even though everyone is enamored with GUI's,
mice, PC's, etc., terminals are still the preferred "human interface
device" in applications where reliability is paramount (e.g., airline
reservations systems). There's little to go wrong in a terminal, and,
once the firmware has been debugged (as was the case with the WY-60 long
ago), the system stability is limited only by the host machine. The
three WY-60's I have here (which are still in use -- I prefer them for
editing source code and performing admin on our UNIX boxes) have been in
service for close to 11 years, two of which still have the original CRT.

Anyhow, time marches on and I imagine a time will come when terminals
will take their place in computer museums alongside Tele-Type machines,
Osborne "luggables" and eight inch floppy drives. So, as the old saying
goes, the king is dead. Long live the king!
