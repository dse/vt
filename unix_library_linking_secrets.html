<H2>Five Special Secrets of Linking with Libraries</H2>

<P>
There are five essential, non-obvious conventions to master when using
libraries.  These aren't explained very clearly in most C books or
manuals, probably because the language documenters consider linking to
be part of the surrounding operating system, while the operating system
people view linking as part of the language.  As a result, no one makes
much more than a passing reference to it unless someone from the linker
team gets involved!
</P>

<P>
Here are the essential UNIX linking facts of life:
</P>

<OL>

<BR>
<LI> Dynamic libraries are called    <TT>lib<I>something</I>.so</TT>,
     and static libraries are called <TT>lib<I>something</I>.a</TT>

<P>
By convention, all dynamic libraries have a filename of the form
<TT>lib<I>name</I>.so</TT> (version numbers may be appended to the
name).  Thus the library of thread routines is called
<TT>lib<I>thread</I>.so</TT>.

</P>

<BR>
<LI> You tell the compiler to link with, for example, 
     <TT>libthread.so</TT> by giving the option <TT>-lthread</TT>

<P>
The command line argument to the C compiler doesn't mention the entire
pathname to the library file.  It doesn't even mention the full name of 
the file in the library directory!  Instead, the compiler is told to 
link against a library with the command line option <TT>-l<I>name</I></TT>
where the library is called <TT>lib<I>name</I>.so</TT>--in other
words, the "<TT>lib</TT>" part and the file extension are dropped, and 
<TT>-l</TT> is jammed on the beginning instead.
</P>

<BR>
<LI> The compiler expects to find the libraries in certain directories.

<P>
At this point, you may be wondering how the compiler knows in which
directory to look for the libraries.  Just as there are special rules
for where to find header files, so the compiler looks in a few special
places such as <TT>/usr/lib/</TT> for libraries. For instance, the
threads library is in <TT>/usr/lib/libthread.so</TT>.
</P>

<P>
The compiler option <TT>-L<I>pathname</I></TT> is used to tell the 
linker a list of other directories in which to search for libraries
that have been specified with the <TT>-l</TT> option. There are a
couple of environment variables, <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> and 
<TT>LD_RUN_PATH</TT>, that can also be used to provide this
information.  Using these environment variables is now
<A HREF = "http://www.visi.com/~barr/ldpath.html"
>officially frowned on</A>,
for reasons of security, performance, and build/execute
independence.  Use the <TT>-L<I>pathname</I></TT>
<TT>-R<I>pathname</I></TT> options at linktime instead.
</P>

<BR>
<LI> Identify your libraries by looking at the header files you have used.

<P>
Another key question that may have occurred to your is, "How do I know
which libraries I have to link with?"  The answer, as (roughly
speaking) enunciated by Obi-Wan Kenobi in <I>Star Wars</I>, is,
"Use the source, Luke!"  If you look at the source of your program,
you'll notice routines that you call, but which you didn't implement.
For example, if your program does trigonometry, you've probably called
routines with names like <TT>sin()</TT> or <TT>cos()</TT>, and these are
found in the math library.  The manpages show the exact argument types
each routine expects, and should mention the library it's in.
</P>

<P>
A good hint is to study the <TT>#include</TT>s that your program uses.
Each header file that you include potentially represents a library
against which you must link.  This tip carries over into C++, too.
A big problem of name inconsistency shows up here.  Header files
usually do not have a name that looks anything like the name of the
corresponding library.  Sorry!  This is one of the things you "just
have to know" to be a C wizard.  Table 5-1 shows examples of some
common ones.

<P>
Another inconsistency is that a single library may contain routines
that satisfy the prototypes declared in multiple header files.  For
example, the functions declared in the header files
<TT>string.h</TT>, <TT>stdio.h</TT>, and <TT>time.h</TT> are all
usually supplied in the single library <TT>libc.so</TT>.  If you're
in doubt, use the <TT>nm</TT> utility to list the routines that a
library contains.  More about this in the next heuristic!

<P>
If you're trying to link a program and get this kind of error:

<PRE>
    ld: Undefined symbol
        _xdr_reference
    *** Error code 2
    make: Fatal error: Command failed for target 'prog'
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Here's how you can locate the libraries with which you need to link.
The basic plan is to use <TT>nm</TT> to look through every library
in /usr/lib, grepping for the symbols you're missing.  The linker
looks in /usr/ccs/lib and /usr/lib by default, and so should you.
If this doesn't get results, extend your search to all other library
directories (such as /usr/openwin/lib), too.
</P>

<PRE>
    $ /usr/bin/csh
    % cd /usr/lib
    % foreach i (lib?*)
    ? echo $i
    ? nm $i | grep xdr_reference | grep -v UNDEF
    ? end
    . . .
    libc.so
    libc.so.1
    libnsl.so
    [2491]  |    217028|     196|FUNC |GLOB |0    |8     |xdr_reference
    libposix4.so
    . . .
    % exit
    $ 
</PRE>

<P>
This runs "nm" on each library in the directory, to list the symbols
known in the library.  Pipe it through <TT>grep</TT> to limit it to the
symbol you are searching for, and filter out symbols marked as 
"<TT>UNDEF</TT>" (referenced, but not defined in this library). 
The result shows you that <TT>xdr_reference</TT> is in <TT>libnsl</TT>. 
You need to add  <TT>-lnsl</TT> on the end of the compiler command line.
</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<LI> Symbols from static libraries are extracted in a more restricted
     way than symbols from dynamic libraries

<P> 
Finally, there's an additional and big difference in link semantics
between dynamic linking and static linking that often confuses the
unwary.  Archives (static libraries) are acted upon differently than
are shared objects (dynamic libraries). With dynamic libraries, 
<I>all</I> the library symbols go into the virtual address space of
the output file, and <I>all</I> the symbols are available to all the
other files in the link.  In contrast, static linking looks only 
through the archive for the <I>undefined</I> symbols presently
known to the loader at the time the archive is processed.
</P>

<P>
A simpler way of putting this is to say that the order of the
statically linked libraries on the compiler command line is
significant.  The linker is fussy about where libraries are
mentioned, and in what order, since symbols are resolved looking
from left to right.  This makes a difference if the same symbol
is defined differently in two different libraries.  If you're
doing this deliberately, you probably know enough not to need
to be reminded of the perils.
</P>

<P>
Another problem occurs if you mention the static libraries before
your own code.  There won't be any undefined symbols yet, so 
nothing will be extracted.  Then, when your object file is 
processed by the linker, all its library references will be
unfulfilled!  Although the convention has been the same since UNIX
started, many people find it unexpected; very few commands demand
their arguments in a particular order, and those that do usually
complain about it directly if you get it wrong.  All novices have
trouble with this aspect of linking until the concept is explained.
Then they just have trouble with the concept itself.
</P>

<P>
The problem most frequently shows up when someone links with the
math library. The math library is heavily used in many benchmarks
and applications, so we want to squeeze the last nanosecond of
runtime performance out of it.  As a result, <TT>libm</TT> has
often been a statically linked archive.  So, if you have a program
that uses some math routines such as the <TT>sin()</TT> function,
and you link statically like this:
</P>

<PRE>
    cc -lm main.c
</PRE>

<P>
you will get an error message like this:
</P>

<PRE>
    Undefined                     first referenced
     symbol                           in file
     sin                              main.o
    ld: fatal: Symbol referencing errors.  No output written to a.out
</PRE>

<P>
In order for the symbols to get extracted from the math library, you
need to put the file containing the unresolved references first, like so:
</P>

<PRE>
    cc main.c -lm
</PRE>

<P>
This causes no end of angst for the unwary. 
Everyone is used to the general command form of
&lt;command&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;files&gt;, so to have the linker
adopt the different convention of 
&lt;command&gt; &lt;files&gt; &lt;options&gt; is very confusing.
It's exacerbated by the fact that it will silently accept the first
version and do the wrong thing.

At one point, Sun's compiler group amended the compiler drivers so that
they coped with the situation.  We changed the SunOS 4.x unbundled
compiler drivers from SC0.0 through SC2.0.1 so they would "do the
right thing" if a user omitted <TT>-lm</TT>.  Although it was the
right thing, it was different from what AT&amp;T did, and broke our
compliance with System V Interface Definition; so the former behavior
had to be reinstated. In any case, from SunOS 5.2 onwards, a 
dynamically linked version of the math library
<TT>/usr/lib/libm.so</TT> is provided

Similar problems have been seen on PC's, where the Borland compiler
drivers tried to guess whether floating-point libraries needed to be
linked in.  Unfortunately, they sometimes guessed wrongly, leading
to the error:
</P>

<PRE>
    scanf: floating point formats not linked
    Abnormal program termination
</PRE>

<P>
They seem to guess wrongly when the program uses floating-point
formats in <TT>scanf()</TT> or <TT>printf()</TT> but doesn't call
any other floating-point routines.  The workaround is to give the
linker more of a clue, by declaring a function like this in a module
that will be included in the link:
</P>

<PRE>
    static void forcefloat( float *p )
    { float f = *p; forcefloat( &f ); }
</PRE>

<P>
You don't actually have to call the function, merely ensure that
it is linked in.  This provides a solid enough clue to the Borland
PC linker that the floating-point library really is needed.
</P>

<!-- (The following was important only in the pre-Pentium era.) -->
<P>
NB: a similar message, saying "floating point not loaded" is printed
by the Microsoft C runtime system when the software needs a numeric
coprocessor but your computer doesn't have one installed.  You fix
it by relinking the program, using the floating-point emulation
library.

The "<TT>-D</TT>" option was introduced with SunOS 5.3 (Solaris 2.3)
to provide better link-editor debugging.  The option (fully documented
in the Linker and Libraries Manual) allows the user to display the
link-editing process and input file inclusion.  It's especially
useful for monitoring the extraction of objects from archives. It
can also be used to display runtime bindings.
