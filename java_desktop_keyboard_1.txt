   Xterminal keyboard doesn't worked when using Sun Java Desktop System 3

   Hello, Solaris Community!
   We have Solaris 10 installed on Sun Blade 1000.
   When connected to Gnome(Sun Java Desktop System 3) Xterminal from PC
   using X-Win v6.1 Xterminal client keyboard input doesn't work. Mouse
   works properly and there are no any another bugs. When connected to
   CDE Xterminal keyboard work fine. Have you any suggestions about it?
   Sincerely yours, TafKoS

   I'm in the same boat. I had to revert to 9 so I can't test it right
   now, but the same setup works under 9's gnome desktop, but under 10
   and JDS 3 I have no keyboard from Cygwin/xfree. The keyboard and
   monitor for the sunblade work just fine.

   Any updates on this? I am having exactly the same issue. No keyboard
   input to SJD 3.
   Thanks!

   Does anyone have a fix for this yet or is the Java Desktop simply
   unusable?

   I met the same problem:
   when using Xterminal software, no keyboard response under
   JDS in Solaris 10 GA version, though I am using commercial Xterminal
   software: Reflection X 11.0.0 from WRQ, so the problem is not
   restricted to only Cgywin or others alike.
   Waiting for Sun's solution...

   Having the same problem. Originally I thought it was a XFree/Cygwin
   issue. See:

   You can't use your keyboard, and I can't use my home, end, pageup, and
   pagedown keys inside of gnome-terminal form the system in question
   (not remotely). JDS has been a blowout of annoyances for me.

   It's really beginning to bug me. Is Sun becoming like Microsoft
   (releasing a half finished product) ?

   Solaris' xterm terminfo database entry does not define key
   sequences for these keys.
   Can be fixed by re-compiling the xterm entry, with khome, kend,
   knp, kpp sequences defined:
mkdir /tmp/foo
env TERMINFO=/usr/share/lib/terminfo /bin/infocmp xterm > /tmp/foo/xterm.ti
echo ' knp=\E[6~, kpp=\E[5~, kend=\EOF, khome=\EOH, ' >> /tmp/foo/xterm.ti
env TERMINFO=/tmp/foo /bin/tic -v /tmp/foo/xterm.ti

env TERMINFO=/tmp/foo less /etc/termcap

   For gnome-terminal, you must replace the original
   /usr/share/lib/terminfo/x/xterm file with the new one in
   /tmp/foo/x/xterm, then stop all gnome-terminal processes and
   restart gnome-terminal.

   i was rather hoping for a workaround for the original issue, keyboard
   under jds using exceed or pcxware for example..

   I have JDS working on a Intel box connecting to Exceed on Windows XP.
   I would be happy to compare configurations if that would help.
