I'd recommend one of the Reflection Series of HP terminal emulators
from Walker Richer & Quinn.  They have an entire line of terminal
emulators.  They have DOS and Window's versions available.  You can
reach them at:

    1-800-872-2839

In fact, HP is dropping AdvanceLink and is now bundling WRQ's software
with some of their PC packages.

Another question (and answer from HP-FAQ):

6.4 How can I put a title in my hpterm titlebar?

Here is a two line program that you might find useful:

/* Quick and dirty program to put argv[1] in the title bar of an hpterm
   Tom Arons March 1992
*/
#include <string.h>
main(argc,argv)
        int argc; char **argv;
{
        printf("\033&f0k%dD%s", strlen(argv[1]), argv[1]);
        printf("\033&f-1k%dD%s", strlen(argv[1]), argv[1]);
}

An alternative is:

#!/bin/sh
LENGTH=`strlen $1`
echo "&f0k${LENGTH}D$1\c"

In case in gets mangled, that's ESC between the first quote and the f0k.

strlen, in case you don't have it, comes from:

#include <stdio.h>

main(argc, argv)
   int argc;
   int *argv[];
{
   if (argc != 2)
      exit(0);
   printf("%d\n", strlen(argv[1]));
}

(Thanks to Tom Arons <arons@ash.eecs.ucdavis.edu>
and John T. Beck, [then] of HP.)

From the HP-UX FAQ:

Subject: 6.3  How do I get a scroll bar on hpterms?

Set the following resources:

HPterm*scrollBar:       TRUE
HPterm*saveLines:       1024

or some other other arbitrarily large number.  To do this interactively, use
"hpterm -sb -sl 1024". You can also set these in an app-default file
(/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/HPterm). You can also set saveLines to something
like "4s", which indicates four screens.

If you want the VUE panel terminal icon produce hpterm's that have
scroll bars, and also have their login shell run at the startup of
the terminal.  To do this you have to modify the default action of the
VUE panel.  The easiest way to do this on a system-wide basis is
to edit the "/usr/vue/types/xclients.vf" file. Change the line that says
"hpterm" to "hpterm -ls -sb -sl 400":

/usr/vue/types/xclients.vf

ACTION Hpterm
        TYPE            COMMAND
        WINDOW-TYPE     NO-STDIO
        EXEC-STRING     hpterm -ls -sb -sl 400
        DESCRIPTION     The Hpterm action starts an hpterm terminal
                        emulator.

Subject: 6.10  How come I can no longer disable the caps lock key with xmodmap?

A common activity in the past has been to disable the, shall we say,
"placement challenged" caps lock key on the ITF keyboard using a simple
xmodmap script.  This no longer works consistently at X11R5/VUE 3.0; the best
solution so far:

In file ~/.vue/sessions/lite/vue.session:

/usr/bin/X11/xmodmap - << EOF
        clear lock
        keycode 55 = Control_L
        keycode 86 = Caps_Lock
        keycode 39 = grave asciitilde guillemotleft guillemotright
        keycode 71 = Escape
        add Lock = Caps_Lock
        add Control = Control_L
EOF

This works until logout/login, when Caps Lock toggles the control feature,
even though 'xmodmap -pm' shows that Lock has no assignments. You have to
restart the server to reset completely, which can be automated by setting the
value

Vuelogin*terminateServer:   True

in the file /usr/vue/config/Xconfig.

These terminals are Hewlett Packard Compatibles. They came from
a Silicon Valley company that may not exist any more.

I agree, neat features, but Caveat Emptor where you use them.

        Cumulus was a manufacturer based in the Silicon Gulch.

        They made an HP compatible device from about 1987 to 1991. They put a
lot of time into creating ASIC chips to do the whole thing, to reduce costs.

        They raised money on the Vancouver Exchange to get the company going,
and it floundered while the founders drove their Mercedes.

        A good friend was their VP of Sales and Marketing -- he bailed out
very quickly.

        The founder, I think, was Steve Auditor(sic) who became a self-
proclaimed expert on X terminals after the Cumulus fiasco.

To answer the first question, vt is part of HP's proprietary Network
Services package, so Sun probably won't have vt services available. 
If anyone knows that they actually do, please let me know immediately!

Why not use telnet? Well, vt is typically a better performing protocol
than telnet. Additionally, I'm not sure if standard telnet will support
HP's block-mode terminal processing, which is another HP proprietary
product. It's much more IO-efficient than character-based IO. But
again, I doubt Sun is going to develop software to support these 
HP things.

More like four, or maybe three if you can type that logon string
really fast.  Those TCP acknowledgements need to be sent somehow, and
you probably won't be able to piggyback more than one of them.  But
what's a packet or two between friendly hosts?

With the WIN/TCP for MPE/V Telnet server, block mode works just fine,
thank you.  (The client is another matter, but its hangup is mostly in
classic MPE terminal I/O.)  And guess what -- block mode is the other
place Telnet performance can approach VT.
 
Even when you're in Telnet's "character" (as opposed to Telnet "line"
mode), Telnet doesn't require that you send each character in its own
individual packet; if you can get a bunch of characters ready to go in
a reasonably short time you can do one big network write and get them
all out there in one (or more) large packets -- not too unlike a VT
read completion in terms of number of packets.  As it happens, HP
terminals (and emulators thereof) are pretty good at getting a bunch
of characters ready to go in a reasonably short time when they're in
block mode, so the real requirement is that you not have a boneheaded
Telnet client that insists on sending each character wrapped in its
own packet.
 
VT has two advantages over Telnet.  First, it forces the client to do
presentation details like echoing and line editing for edited-mode
reads, so that you don't have to waste your 3000 and/or network
dealing with it.  As a side effect it cuts down on network traffic.
Line-mode Telnet can do this too, but since line-mode is an option
(and not a terribly well-supported one as far as I know) any Telnet
server is likely to require local support for line editing facilities.
 
(Hmmm.  I seem to have forgotten enough about line-mode Telnet that
I'm really not sure whether all the little twisty passages of MPE line
editing could actually fit into it.)
 
The other is that VT (so far as I know) keeps its control information
somewhat more out-of-band than Telnet, and so it doesn't have to make
a pass through the incoming and outgoing data looking for special
bytes (as does Telnet).

Go to the communications menu and make sure that the receive buffering is
set properly to whatever your device is set for.  That block indicates that
a character was not received properly (there is no ASCII character for it)
probably due to buffer overruns.  If that doesn't do it, crank up the
size of the receive buffer.

This question comes up rather often, and I'd add it to our FAQ if I
actually knew the answer.  Below are several contradictory messages which
might or might not help.  The important thing to note is that some people
have file transfer between the HP-48 and MS-DOS Kermit working just fine.
Maybe the discrepencies in opinions and experience can be explained by
different HP-48 models having different communications characteristics.

If it is MS-DOS Kermit (current version 3.14), you will need to
configure it specially for connection to the HP-48.  First of all,
the HP-48 doesn't support any kind of flow control, so tell Kermit to:

  SET FLOW NONE

Secondly, the HP-48 serial port is unable to receive characters for a
fraction of a second when it is switching from sending to receiving.
But since it does not support flow control, it doesn't have any way of
telling your PC not to send during that time.  So you have to tell Kermit
to pause after each packet.  Try one or both of these:

  set send pause 1000
  set receive pause 1000

The number is milliseconds, so 1000 of them = 1 second.  You might be able
to make it smaller, or you might have to make it bigger.

You are not giving much info here.
Be sure to: set con p all
for transferrs to the hp48.
also be sure you: set flow xon

Tell us exactly what your settings are on both hp and kermit, and what
version of kermit you are using.

Actually, the hp does use xon/xoff.  
Also, you MUST set con p all.
Below is what I have always used, put it in your k95custom.ini.
Omit the line that says set protocol if you are using 3.14.
Don't need to mess with the send pause.

Note:  If the following does not work, then you have another problem..

Hello Mr Random,

The HP2392A is an terminal suitable for connection to a HP3000 (or
similar) host computer. I don't think you can use it as a monitor. It
connects via something called a 'European modem cable', which has more
pins. This is how we do it with our HP hosts, anyway.

Good luck.

  This is an HP-HIL keyboard, used for many years on HP workstations.

  Being unique to HP (albeit a rather innovative design), it has gone
  the way of many good designs in favor of a less agile solution (albeit
  pervasive usage): the PC keyboard interface.

  HIL was rather nifty in that you could daisy chain a mouse, a button box,

  HP's Vectra computer line could save 2-3 I/O cards, useful for small I/O

  [a guess]

If your "Centronics" connector has 24 pins, then your terminal
is built to use an IEEE-488 interface, otherwise known as HP-IB
(Hewlett-Packard Instrument Bus) or GPIB (General Purpose
Instrumentation Bus).

For introductory information on IEEE-488, see:

Nope, it's a standard RS-232 with a funny connector.  Pins 2 and 3 are
transmit and receive, 7 is ground, just like with a DB-25 connector.

   [Archiver's note: see below for a 2nd opinion....]

However, this terminal also has a "port 2" with a DB-25 connector, and
you can go to one of the menus off the MODES menu to set port 2 to
be the main port used.

I have a couple of HP2622D's which are a special version for use with
an HP-250 business computer.

Main difference between the 2622A type is in the EPROMs and PAL chips
in the terminal control board. The interface is actually RS232 on
either unit.

About the "Centronics"-type connector which that person sees at the
back of his 2622A:

It is in fact a 50-pin connector. It is of the same type as the 36-pin
Centronics connector everybody sees on the back of their desktop
printers (which use the 8-bit parallel interface)--the de facto
"Centronics Interface". These connectors, along with the 24-pin
IEEE-488/HPIB/GPIB style, are of the same series introduced maybe
30-40 years ago or so by, I believe, Amphenol--their good old "Micro
Ribbon" family, derived from their older "Blue Ribbon" family.

HP in this case used the 50-pin Micro Ribbon connector to attach a
separate cable to this family of terminals which has the 'normal'
25-pin RS232 connector at the other end.

  I missed this thread's beginning...here's the info:

    The large Centronics-like connector is an HP proprietary connector
    that was designed to use a number of different interfaces, and by
    using a different cable, access other serial connections.  I have
    never seen an HP terminal with an HPIB connector.

    There are several versions of the cables, but for do-it-yourself
    cables, there are just 2...modem and direct connect.  The direct
    connect cable would plug into a DTE computer port directly while
    the modem cable goes directly into a modem.

    Be aware that terminals of that vintage (early to mid 1980's) were
    designed for use with HP 3000 and HP 1000 computers where pacing was
    much more complex, using both ENQ/ACK to handle data flow and
    DC1/DC2 for block mode operation.  This connector even has clock
    signals (16x) where you can supply the clocking speed and literally
    change the baud rates on the fly with no loss in data.  You'll need
    a manual for complete info.

    Here's the pinouts (the RS-232 column is the 25 pin connector, the
    DIRECT column list the pin on the terminal side to use for a direct
    connect, while the MODEM column lists the pin on the terminal
    connector to use for a modem connection:

Mr. Hassell,  
 
Greetings, 

  I happened to post a problem I was having with an old HP2622A to the
group "comp.terminals" over a year ago, and it turns out that you saw it and
had exactly the information I was looking for. Of course, by the immutable
laws of Usenet, I never saw your reply until I was poking around Richard
Shuford's Web site in search of information for a totally unrelated project
and found extracts of the thread archived there. (Odd, considering I read
comp.terminals on a regular basis.)

 In the meantime I had pestered HP through the formal support contacts my
company maintains (we've got some big HP-9000 iron), tried shaking it out
of general support and eventually tried working through the HP parts
identification center to see if they could somehow get a manual or cable
pinout. Of course, this one has "Option 035" applied which seems to mean
that it actually runs an RS-422 interface, which didn't help anyone at HP
find anything, either. From my SPARC experience I was pretty sure it would
be "interoperable enough" but the HP techs I talked to had their doubts,
to say the least. This went off an on for a few months until I was sure I
had reached a completely dead end. 

  I have to say that everyone I talked to made a valiant effort, but (as
the HP2622 is now well outside its end-of-life as far as HP is concerned)
there doesn't seem to be any way to get anything very definite about it
except an acknowledgment that it once existed; the terminal has been
serving as a doorstop the whole time but I just couldn't bring myself to
throw it out. 

  Well, with the information you provided I was able to take an old SCSI
cable, desolder the connector, and in less than time than it takes to tell
about it had the old beast talking to a PC running Kermit. It's going to
find a home hanging off the FreeBSD server in the back room where it will
actually look quite nice (it's an amazingly crisp display, of course) and
where I'm sure it will become something of a conversation piece. 

  Just thought you might be amused with the story and wanted to express my
thanks for taking the time to answer, even if it took a year for me to
notice. 

		- Vince

Our experience here has been that R1Win is a much more accurate HP
terminal emulator, and consistently has fewer problems. R1Win works fine
over Winsock Telnet, but works better over VT. However, to use it over VT
under Winsock, you have to have the VT part of the 3000 Connection for
Windows product.
 
The downside is that R1 is much more expensive than BSess-like 2:1.

Subject: HP 2645A Terminal: info/pinout wanted

OK, I know everyone threw out these terminals years ago. But perhaps
some of you fellow old-timers
have some of the yellowed curled-at-the-edges docs still lying about.
Here's what I am looking for:

(1) Serial interface pinout for the HP 2645A terminal. It's a card-edge
connector, not a D connector.

    For bonus points:

(2) Some idea of the protocol used by the host computer for accessing
those little built-in tape drives
(like "read block" or "rewind tape" etc.) Did HP ever actually document
this??

Many thanks in advance, and public accolades to the folks that can come
up with the info. If you feel
this info would be of interest to other group readers, by all means
please post, otherwise email is
probably sufficient.

Mike,

There is a plethora of info in this HP manual:
	POINT-TO-POINT WORKSTATION I/O 
	Reference Manual 
	HP Part No.  30000-90250
	Product HP AdvanceNet
	Edition U0487
	Printed Apr 1987

Note that you will have trouble ordering this from HP, as it is out of
print.  However, it is on the HP LaserROM doc set for the HP3000.

I'll send you some stuff from this manual in a seperate email, as it is
pretty large.  If anyone else out there would like this info, ask (if
demand is great enough (yeah right) I can go ahead and post it.)

I don't think there is an actual pinout for your edge connector in the
stuff I'm sending you (though I do have a grainy bitmap of what it looks
like.)  However, I wouldn't expect that there is anything fancy going on. 
For example, I have a 2624B terminal, and it uses a 50 pin connector that
looks like a jumbo Centronics printer connector.  All those pins, and they
are just shoving RS-232 over it-- Rx, Tx and ground...

> (2) Some idea of the protocol used by the host computer for accessing

I saw no reference to the tape drive in this manual.  I wonder if it is
used for local data logging?  Or, do you know that the thing was supposed
to explicitly be available as an I/O device to the host it connected to? 
Some of the 26xx family had thermal printers built in to them, but they
were local "screen capture" printers, or could be used as passthrough
printers.  They were not considered as seperate printer devices from the
host's point of view...  If this is the case with your tape drive, you may
have to control it with escape codes.  Who knows...  Do the built-in setup
screens offer any info?

OK, it looks like I found some info on the tape drive...

I'm guessing that the "terminal peripherals" are treated as passthrough
devices, as it looks like the terminal  has no extra I/O definitions.  And,
it looks like data xfers to them are handled with a "user block transfer",
which I have not heard of before.  Finally, it looks like $CTUL, $CTUR,
$HARD, etc. are hardcoded OS IDs.  Presumably the OS knows how to generate
the proper escape codes. 

Do you have access to an HP3000?  IF so you could do a capture and see what
the host was trying to send to you.  Where did you get this terminal?  A
terminal with a built-in tape drive sounds pretty cool!

Hope this helps.  Have fun!

Enabling and Disabling User Block Transfers 
 
User mode block transfers (from block mode terminals such as the HP
2644/2645) can be enabled or disabled with the FCONTROL intrinsic.  User
mode block transfers are disabled in normal MPE operation.  The DC2
(CONTROL-R), transmitted by the terminal when you press ENTER, is passed
to your program for action At this point you may write escape sequences
to the terminal (i.e., to position the cursor) before reading the data
from the terminal.
 
The format for this application of the FCONTROL intrinsic is:
 
               IV       IV         L
     FCONTROL (filenum,controlcode,anyinfo);
 
The parameters are:
 

 
filenum          Integer by value (required).  A word identifier
                 supplying the file number of the terminal
 
controlcode      Integer by value (required).  The integer 28 to disable
                 user mode block transfers, or 29 to enable user mode
                 block transfers.
 
anyinfo          Logical (required).  Any variable or word identifier.
                 This parameter is needed by FCONTROL to satisfy the
                 internal requirements of this intrinsic; however, it
                 serves no other purpose and is not modified by the
                 intrinsic.
 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
NOTE  Data overruns may occur during block mode transfers.  Your
      applications programs must check for successful completion of each
      FREAD operation and retry as required.  Since a data overrun on the
      last character read will cause the port to hang on the ADCC (Series
      30/33/40/44).  The normal block read timer will not work for own 
      handshaking.

Chapter 6  Using FCOPY with Terminal Peripherals 
 
Some HP 3000 terminals have their own peripheral devices.  Terminal
peripheral devices include cartridge tape units, mini-tape units, floppy
disk drives, and printers.  If you are using a terminal with such
peripherals, you can use FCOPY to copy files between system devices and
the terminal peripherals.

 
 
 
Using File Designators 
 
You specify a peripheral device in an FCOPY command by using its file
designator as the fromfile or tofile.  Table 6-1 lists terminal
peripherals, their corresponding terminals, and their file designators:
 
          Peripheral Devices and Designators

------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
For example, you can use the following command to copy a disk file named
SAMPLE to the left cartridge tape unit of an HP 2645 terminal:
 
     >FROM=SAMPLE;TO=$CTUL 



 
 
 
Terminal Settings 
 
In order to copy to or from terminal peripherals, your terminal type must
be set to 10 or 12 (depending on your terminal), message reception must
be turned off, and the parity toggle switch must be set to NONE. FCOPY
checks these settings before it begins to copy the files you specified in
a command that references a terminal peripheral device.  If your terminal
is not set correctly, FCOPY prompts you to log on again and set the
terminal type using the TERM parameter.  For more information on terminal
types, refer to the System Operation and Resources Management Reference 
Manual (32033-90005) for MPE V/E or Controlling System Activity Reference 
Manual (32650-90155) for MPE XL. If message reception is not turned off,
FCOPY turns it off for you.  Before copying the files, FCOPY prompts you
to set the parity toggle switch. 



 
 
 
Copying Between Terminal Peripheral Devices 
 
Although you can use FCOPY to copy from one peripheral device to another,
it is usually more efficient to use the local capabilities of the
terminal.  Refer to documentation describing your terminal for
instructions for copying between local devices.
 
 
 
Examples 
 
The following examples show how to use FCOPY to copy to and from terminal
peripheral devices.
 
The command below copies the first file on the right cartridge tape unit
of an HP 2645 terminal to the disk file named DFILE1:
 
     >FROM=$CTUR;TO=DFILE1 
 
The command in the next example displays the disk file named DFILE4 on
the HP 2644A terminal line printer in both octal and character formats:
 
     >FROM=DFILE4;TO=$HARD;OCTAL;CHAR 
 
The command below copies the third file on the magnetic tape unit MAGTP
to the left cartridge tape unit of an HP 2645 terminal:
 
     >FROM=*MAGTP;TO=$CTUL;SKIPEOF=3;SUBSET 


==========================================================
 
Appendix B  File Definitions:  Default Values 
 
Appendix B summarizes the default file definition values that FCOPY uses
to open a tofile or fromfile.  It contains two tables:  table B-1 shows
default values for different types of fromfiles, and table B-2 shows
default values for different types of tofiles.  The information stored in
the file label of an existing disk file always describes its
characteristics.
 
Items marked with a "plus" sign (+) are those most likely to cause
problems when you are copying from one device to another.  Refer to the
File System Reference Manual (30000-90236) or Accessing Files Progammer's 
Guide (32650-90017) for information about domains, buffers, and record
formats.
 
You can override a file's default definition before you issue an FCOPY
command.  Simply redefine its characteristics using the MPE FILE command
and then use an asterisk (*) to backreference the FILE command in the
FCOPY command.

Mike, 

I found one more thing, from the HP Fundamental Data Communications
Handbook (5957-4634, obsolete).  Chapter 2, Async.

There is a hodgepodge of charts, etc.  One of the charts covers the pinout
of an edge-card cable.  I have paraphrased it below.

The modem/host end is a male DB25.  The typical HP3000 system only used 3
wires-- Rx, Tx and Gnd (2,3 and 7).  That the cable diagram indicates
hardware flow control connections suggests that the terminal can support
them.  However, to work with the 3-wire HP controllers, the terminal had to
be able to work with just software flow control.  If you want software flow
control, you should be able to pick this from the config menus (I'm
assuming that the 2645 has software config, not dip switches....)

Hope this helps, lcl

...

Since you have a couple of connectors on the back, the correct one is on 
the card labeled 'datacom' or 'enh datacom'. The easiest way to tell 
which one is to open the terminal and look. All cards are labeled  on 
the top.

To open the terminal... It is hinged at the back and there are two 
latches near the front. Along each side of the terminal is the joint 
between the top and bottom. About 1.5 inches from the front of the joint 
is a small gap. The latches are through the gap. Straighten a paper clip 
and insert to unlatch the top. You should only need to insert the clip 
about  1/2 inch, no more. (Doing this with the power off is advised.)

Unlatch both sides and the terminal can be opened. There is a catch at 
the back to hold it open.

These terminals generally were used with ENQ-ACK handshake. You may want 
to check the setup to verify the handshake.

Enjoy,

Craig

The part number for a modem cable for a 2648A terminal is: 02640-60131-1
if that is any help.

From the description of the connectors, it sounds about the same.

NOTE: you CANNOT use this port if you are using the built-in modem.

The port uses the 40233A cable to connect to modem or 40234A to connect
to a terminal.

I don't have the pinouts handy but someone else should have it. If not,

If you install PHNE_11017 on a 10.20 system, and also some filesets from
the s300 media for 9.10, then your s300 machines can be used with HP-UX
10.20.  .   For more information see:


"Interoperability Guide for HP-UX 9.x/10.x" (part number 5964-1370) 
"Updating to HP-UX 9.10" (part number B1864-90101).

The idea is that a s300 machine can boot from a s700 or s800 10.20 server 
as a special kind of diskless client.  The s300 gets a special executable 
(kernel) that turns it into an X Terminal.  It is a good way to get some
additional value out of your s300 hardware when all your s700/800 systems
have moved to 10.x.

Nope.  The 715/50 is the last of the fixed-frequency video workstations.
Later models (such as 715/64 and 715/100 and 712/xx) have the multisync
capability, but the earlier ones do not.
 
How to tell the difference on any random workstation?  Look at the graphics
console at first power-up.  If you see a color VUE-like image (red and
grey) it is a new machine with multisync.  If you see white text, it is an
old machine.
 
How to tell the difference on a workstation with RS232 console?  Power the
machine on and hold down the <ESC> key to prevent autoboot.  Then look at
the text on the screen.  If you are at the BOOT_ADMIN> prompt with a
screenful of HELP text, you have a new machine with multisync.  If you are
looking at a more ordinary prompt with no HELP text, it is an old machine.
 
BOOTP was introduced (in the bootROM) at the same time as the multisync
capability.  So a machine with multisync uses the BOOTP protocol to boot
diskless over the network.  Older machines use the much more primitive and
proprietary RMP protocol with rbootd.  All of the s200/300/400 machines use
RMP, and so does the 715/50.

XFree86 xterm uses the vt100-style codes for F1-F4 (the bogus
vt220-style codes are still available via a resource setting).

The XFree86 3.3.2 xterm supports ANSI color and VT220 emulation

We sold a bunch of them at $250.  So that gives you and idea of what
they are worth.  Basically, if you want a very cheap HP-UX box, then
use them.  However, you will not be able to use your basic PC-type
monitor.

The Envizex is an X-Terminal.  No hard drive required, but you will
need either a server with the X-software, or a special ROM firmware
chip which plugs into the Envizex.

Gary,

I believe the C1400 keyboard is usually shipped with the HP700/xx
terminal line.  I just tried plugging a C1400 into a HP2392A and saw the
same results that you have noted.  My 2392A  keyboard is part number:

Subject: Re: Help! HP 700/60 Terminals & SCO UNIX

John,

The hp700/60 is a strange beast indeed. I have one here hooked up to my
linux box in vt320 mode, which works fine in most cases (only fscks up
one vttest case).

The terminal has vt320 and wyse60 emulation (amongst others), of which the
latter provides a 132x48 emulation. However, since the most complete term-
cap entries are available for the DEC compatible terminals (does anyone
object?), I went with the flow and used that.

The cable you'd have to use is a crossed-out one (the usual 2-3, 3-2, 4-5,
5-4, 6/8-21, 7-7, 21-6/8, but observe that the 700/60 has a f plug where
you might have expected a m one).

Since three communication ports (25f primary, 25f printer, 9m secondary)
are available, of which primary and secondary may be used for host-terminal
communications, you'd also have to make sure you selected the correct
one to go with your connection.

ps. local echo can be turned on in the system setup under local echo. This
would also be the exact place to turn it off, which might be of rather more

pps. can you cu -l /dev/yourmodemline -s yourspeed to the terminal? If not,
you should look into the cable (and the permissions of /dev/something and
/yoursbin/cu). a

ppps. The device consented to a quite satisfactory 19200 bps transmission
rate (over some 10 m!) after turning off hardware _and_ software
handshaking.  thus is life.

I see you've had several answers for the UX world. Let me stab at
MPE world, i.e. the HP3000

It's been a while, so take this with a grain of salt. First,
comp.sys.hp.mpe is a reasonable place to ask the 3000 questions.

Second, when I left the 3000 the 700 series terminals were supported
on the 3000 and the 2392 was as well. But that may have changed in the
3 years it's been since I played MPE.

Hope this helps and sorry I can't give you the definitive answer.

 WARNINGS
      HP supports only terminals listed on the current list of supported
      devices.  However, non-supported and supported terminals can be in the
      terminfo database.  If you use such non-supported terminals, they may

You need the CDE fonts loaded on the Xterm. On the HP 10.20 box they
should be at /usr/dt/config/xfonts/C/.
You could copy them onto the Linux, or use tftp, or nfs or a font
server (xfs). Then run "xset fp+ /path_to_these_fonts". Now
the 'X -query hp-host' should work. You could setup the boot files
(rc.local ?) on the Linux to load these fonts at system bootup
so you won't need to do it manually again. Sorry, I don't know
any Linux so you'll need to figure that out yourself. But I have
done this on a Windows95 box running an X package; I simply copied
the fonts to the PC's hard drive in the appropriate folder. I
may have had to run a "mkfontdir", don't remember.

well - I use pico only when elm's not working (so this is my guess):

I can see pico on this Solaris box is set up to try to read terminfo and
termcap - so perhaps your copy is built to use termcap (since iirc, HP's
newer terminfo may not be where a naive configure script would find it).
I'd do a strings on pico, verify that it's compiled-in paths for terminfo
match those on my system - if not, the problem likely is an incomplete
or incorrect termcap entry - perhaps set in your $TERMCAP variable.  If
the terminfo path isn't right, you can usually override it with $TERMINFO.

(Both are mentioned in the corresponding man-pages).

I've run vi and similar programs on an hpterm, so I'm reasonably sure arrow
keys work in the program itself.

-- but if it's a different problem, I'm still curious.

Chording of a 2-button mouse to gennerate a 3rd button is only provided
in the HIL driver. For PS/2 devices (and probably USB also), it is
possible to chord B1+B2 and B2+B3 to generate B4 and B5 respectively,
but chording a 2-button mouse has never been supported on HP
workstations.

Reflection 1, now called Reflection for HP, was designed to emulate HP700/9x

There are a couple of free MS Windows-based HP terminal emulators available
for you to try out.  There are directed toward HP3000 users, but since both
HP3000 and HP9000 machines use the same terminals, you should be able to use
these, but please be aware that your milage may vary.....

Zebra:  GPL freeware, includes source code, serial comm only.
        http://www.coastal.net.au/~ewan/
        [2002: link is stale;  Ewan Thompson seems to have dropped support.]
        [The Gnu Zebra program is not the same thing; that's a routing daemon.]

QCterm/QCwin, from AICS Research
        http://aics-research.com/emulate.html
        http://www.aics-research.com/qcterm/index.html

Some things to watch out for:

Since Zebra was developed for use with HP3000 machines, it still has trouble
with some of the HP escape codes.  SAM on the HP9000 uses the terminal
differently than does VPLUS on the HP3000, so some of the escape code
handlers have been excercised (and debugged) more than others.  A couple of
showstoppers have been fixed, so now SAM will at least run, but it still has
some major display issues, such as menus not painting correctly, garbage
being left on the screen after a menu goes away, a couple of
text-to-linedraw-characterset-switch problems (causes the wrong charset to
be used in a few places) etc.

I have not used QCwin extensively, so I can't speak much about it, other to
say that it is actively maintained and I hear it is pretty solid.

Note: Zebra supports serial connectivity, but not TCP/IP.  QCwin supports
TCP/IP but not serial.  Such is life....  So, you might try Zebra for your
console, but then once you are booted, QCwin may give you better luck for
user sessions, if you are at a point where you can telnet in.

Of course, there are also commercial emulators, such as WRQ's Reflections,
MiniSoft, DynaComm, etc.  Check out Richard Shuford's terminal website for
vendor links.

good luck,
lcl

Thanks for the correction.  I thought I had read it way back in some
HP manual, but obviously my memory failed me.  But of course this is
mostly irrelevant nowadays anyway, as HIL-equipped systems are getting
rare...

[Off-topic: I have three generations of HP hardware here under my
desk, a 715/50, a C200, and a B1000--all use different keyboard
interfaces.  I've always liked HIL best, mostly for the ITF keyboards,
and the fact that the system can detect the language of the keyboard.
No need for /etc/kbdlang and no need for knowing the USASCII layout by
heart for interacting with ISL when a non-US keyboard is connected.
The advantage of PS/2 and USB is that I can easily connect my Kinesis
keyboard.]

Hmmm,
sorry, no direct solution, but have a look at:
/var/X11/Xserver/logs/X0.log
and
/var/dt/Xerrors

maybe this will give you a clue.

Thanks everyone--I think I got it.
I added the line

/dev/hil2     pointer 

to my X0devices file.  This seems to have fixed it.
As it turns out, the SECOND mouse is entirely dead--no response at
all, but I got the first mouse back to its (partially) working state
(which at least tells me the system is functioning properly).
I've got a replacement on the way.

Hi,

Just discovered how to config the terminal...
Maybe it is of interest to someone else.

	Reset terminal to default configuration:

	Turn on terminal while holding "D" key.
	Wait 5-15 seconds, release keys, hear a beep
	press <Right-ALT>, <Right-Shift>, ESC
	press <Return>
	terminal has been reset to default config

	to config:
	press <Right-ALT>, <Right-Shift>, ESC

Regards,
Adilson Ribeiro

If you have an extra keyboard, I can probably use it. I have an HP 700/96
minus its keyboard, and it's a pretty good bet that the 700/94 keyboard will
work (the 700/60 keyboards I have do work, but I don't have an extra one)

Can you describe the connector on the end of the keyboard cable? I'm looking
for a 6-pin, RJ11-style connector, bigger than what telephones use, but
smaller than UTP Ethernet uses.. if your keyboards have this connector, I
definitely want one (assuming you will sell/give me just the keyboard).

Also, is the keyboard a PC or Unix layout? PC has the control key in the
lower left corner and Caps Lock next to the letter A, and `Unix' layouts
are the other way around, usually.

Let me know..

Well, I finally did mess with the /96 last night. The 700/60 and 700/96
are two completely different animals.. If I had to guess, I'd say the /96
is older than the /60: the /60 has a white display, and a much more user-
friendly setup menu. Also the /60 uses a PC-style keyboard layout, whereas
the /96 is a more `classic UNIX' layout: Control is where the PC keeps the
Capslock key, for one thing.

Wouldn't matter: I'm using the 700/60 keyboard with the 700/96 (I don't have
the keyboard for the /96, I got it at the Goodwill :)

I did find the Break key on the /60 keyboard, it was sitting right in front
of my face (the Pause key is also the Break key.. I was looking for a key
that was specific to the terminal, but the standard PC Pause/Break key was
the right one all along). Feel free to deduct points from your estimate of
my IQ :)

I've barely ever used a real VT terminal (a customer was using one for the
console on his Sun box running Linux once, but I was more concerned with
making his ^C and ^Z keys work correctly, which was a Linux problem, not
a VT problem.. you shouldn't use /dev/console for a serial terminal in Linux,
because you can't send signals via the keyboard if you do! Not 100% sure why,
but using /dev/ttyS0 (first serial port) fixes it. But I digress..)

Apparently not. This isn't really a problem, the VT320/220 emulation works
just fine with the TERM variable set to either vt220 or vt320 (I strongly
suspect that the Linux terminfo files are actually not using any of the
220/320-specific stuff, and are treating them both at a VT100). This goes
for both the /60 and the /96, though the keyboard layout is wonky when
using the /96. I actually prefer the control key to be to the left of the
A key, and the /96 does this, but it also transmutes the left Shift key
into another Tab key, which is highly annoying. Since you have a manual
for the /96, you might be able to find out is there's a way to get my Shift
key back...? Probably the correct answer, though, is going to be `Get an
actual 700/96 keyboard instead of using the 700/60 one'..

Both the serial port and the terminal are set to 8-bit characters. I'll try
7 bits and see if that helps any.

That's turning out to be easier said than done. I do have a termcap/terminfo
entry for an HP 700/92 terminal, but apparently this is not even close to
compatible with a 700/96, because when I do this:

TERM=hp70092 export TERM
tput init

...the bottom line of the screen displays `KB Locked' and every keypress
causes a beep rather than the normal soft `tick' noise.. I have to power-
cycle the terminal to get out of this mode. Probably there's a magic key
sequence to get out of this, but it probably involves keys that are present
on a real 700/96 keyboard but not the 700/60 one that I am using..

The 700/96 works well enough in VT220 emulation mode, except for the left
Shift key..

Oh, and my original post mentioned un-pressable keys.. That turned out to
be because the keyboard had small plastic washers underneath the keys to
keep them from being pressed (the Setup, Capslock, and both Alt keys had
them). Apparently when I pried the Setup key off the board, the washer
went flying & I didn't even notice it.

Thanks. The more I read the fewer bone-headed questions I will ask :)

At some point, I'm going to write a `HP Terminals with Linux HOWTO', so
the next guy who comes along with these questions will have something to
read on the subject.. so far I'm still having the annoying problem with
the `screen' help menu mangling the terminal, but otherwise everything
is working more-or-less perfectly.

Off to RTFM...

Ooops, sorry.  I didn't specify which terminal I was speaking of.  You
should see the Break/Reset key (or it shouldat least work) on the 700/96.
I've never used a 700/60.

Now with that said-- although my 700/9x manual discusses the reset key, and
though they have pictures of the keyboards in the manual, I regret to say
that said pictures are too microscopic to actually read-- the text on
keycaps looks like mush.  And, since I don't have a real 700/9x terminal at
home, I'm afraid I can't tell you which key is which....

It has been a few months since I've used a VT320, but I seem to remember
there being a reset function buried somewhere in the onscreen setup menus.
But since this is an emulated VT terminal, perhaps the menus are arranged
differently.

Wow, I don't know about the 700/60.  I wonder if it even has an HP native
mode?  Your list of choices above would indicate not...

This is a wild guess---- The backward questionmark is a classic from my
VT-xxx days-- I remember several times dumping  8 bit characters to my
terminal, but it was in 7 bit mode-- I would see lots of garbage and
backward question marks.  I usually had to power off, or if I was lucky, log

If you do, make sure you get a suitable termcap entry for it.

The 700/96 does have an EM-320 (or was it EM-220?) mode, but I've never used
it....


Here are another couple of URLs:

HP server online docs:
    http://docs.hp.com/hpux/hw/

On this site, there is a downloadable PDF file-- a user's guide for the HP
C1099A terminal.  My guess is that this is a newer model that supercedes the
700/60.  Per the manual, it supports the following emulation modes:  700/96,
Wyse 60, Wyse 5x, ADDS Viewpoint, VT-[320|220|100], PC Terminal, TVI925, and
SCO Console (is this SCO ANSI???)

    http://docs.hp.com/hpux/onlinedocs/hw/c1099a_terminal_um.pdf

Now, this manual isn't a techref, but since it is a users guide it discusses
keyboard layout, using the config menu, etc.

Hopefully the C1099A is close enough to the 700/60 so that this manual will
give you some setup guidance.

Good luck!

Subject: HP 700/60 terminal

Hi.. I am the proud new owner of 2 HP 700/60 and one HP 700/96 terminal.
These are great (using one of the '60s connected to a Linux box to
post this), but I do have a few questions about them..

1) There is a cover on the front, like the cover for the controls on
   most TVs and monitors, but it doesn't have controls behind it (the
   brightness & contrast are sliders, to the right of the cover).
   Opening this cover reveals a slot that looks similar to a PCMCIA
   slot, only the pins are less dense, and also a round hole that looks
   like it's the right size for a PC PS/2-style keyboard connector,
   although there's not a connector there (just a hole). Anyone know
   what these are for?

2) I know how to get into the Setup menu (press the Setup key, duh :)
   But from the Setup menu there doesn't appear to be a Reset option.
   Is there a keystroke combination that acts as a Reset key? I haven't
   found anything yet that will get the terminal out of `alternate
   character set' mode (which it gets into if I forget to run `screen'
   with the -f option.. -f turns on flow control, screen doesn't seem
   to respect my `stty' settings. The result is garbage, and some of
   this garbage sometimes gets interpreted as whatever the code for
   `alt character set' is. I have to power-cycle the terminal to fix
   this, usually).

3) In the Setup menu, there are GLOBAL, USER, SYSTEM, PORT1, PORT3,
   KEYBRD, and PROGRM menus. All of these are accessible with arrow
   keys and PgUp/PgDn, except the PROGRM menu. Does anyone know what
   this menu does, or at least how to access it?

4) Although these terminals use a proprietary 6-pin RJ11-like connector
   (what do you call a 6-pin RJ connector? RJ13?), the keyboards are
   almost identical to the keyboards on some HP Vectra PC's I've used.
   I have yet to take the terminal keyboards apart, but.. Does anyone
   know if these are the same keyboards as PC keyboards, just with
   a different connector? I.E. do they use the same protocol and
   signalling levels? I am doing some research into this because I
   really want to use an IBM Model M keyboard instead of the mushy-
   feeling HP keyboards :)

5) I got a total of 4 keyboards with the terminals, 2 of which work.
   On all but one of the keyboards, the Setup key was un-pressable.
   What I mean is: the key didn't move physically when I tried to
   press it, as though there were something under it or it were glued
   into place. I managed to get one of them to work by prying off
   the keycap with a flat-blade screwdriver and re-seating it (though
   I have to hold it down and wiggle it before the terminal will
   recognize the keypress). Only the Setup key and (on one 'board)
   the Alt keys have this problem. My question is: Is this something
   somebody did on purpose (maybe to keep the users from accidentally
   misconfiguring the terms?)... and if so, what was done, and how
   can I un-do it without breaking the keys? I don't think it was
   glue (no residue), and there was nothing under the key holding it
   up.. but maybe somebody out there knows what trick might have
   been used for this? Doesn't seem like coincidence...

Sorry for the long post, somebody ran me in --verbose mode this
morning. To those who have read this far: Thanks for the attention.

I've got an extremely old (10 years) keyboard, with a HP-HIL
interface,, which HP stopped supporting in 1996.

I'm wondering if anyone out there has ever seen a converter or input
card for a modern PC to be able to use a HP-HIL keyboard.

I know it sounds a bit strange, but I love this keyboard, and its
layout (its like it was designed for a vi user, in fact, I think it
was), and would love to use it to replace my dying model M IBM
keyboard.

Thanks in advance
Stephen Thorne.

I'm afraid it wasn't in fact designed for "vi";  it was designed when
HP-UX was very much a minor interest of HP's (although it was probably
a bigger interest to them than laser printers :-) but you're right, it's
a great "vi" keyboard especially compared to the vile things that come
with PCs.

Who ever thought of putting the Escape key 3 weeks' march northwest of
the keyboard?   I'm not sure where the decision to put the Escape key
next to the shift came from, but the rest of the keys were laid out by
copying them from from IBM Selectric golf-ball typewriters.

Cheers

I don't think that is the console, but then again, an hp9000/832 was
not "supported" with anything other than an HP terminal as the
console.

BTW, an 832, being a PA 1.0 system will not support anything beyond
HP-UX 10.10.  As a system where "NIO/HP-PB" is the "native" bus, it,
and the 842 and 852 are probably in a position to have the best
performance of HP-PB peripherals - in particular the old HP-PB FDDI
NIC.  Now, CPU overheads might be an issue... :) But using say
copyavoidance from HP-UX 9 and the "right" send sizes it should move
along at a nice clip under stuff like netperf.

Yes, you can.  Mine runs with an IBM G54 as well as a Belinea 107050.

(The latter can do--to my surprise--sync on green, so I'm not forced to
specify "configuration -> Terminal -> Monitor "... digital sync".
The IBM only can do digital sync.)

Finally, any multisync monitor with horizontal frequency f(h) >= 80kHz
should do the job.

Some little remark here :

the connector to connect the interface to the workstation differs whether
your workstation is a 715/33 or 715/80.

You can't connect the interface of 715/33, 715/50 to a 715/80, even though
the connector looks the same...

If I recall correctly, from the configuration menu of the 700/96 you can 
select the function of F1 (terminal function, or send F1). It's been a 
long time since I used 700/96.... I'm sure you can configure that in VT220.
