of a terminal session, where you are looking at a display and typing on
a keyboard (or <I>seeming</I> to type on a keyboard, anyway, since that also
can be emulated, with mouse clicks or other inputs).
</P>

<P>
If, however, your computer is running a non-interactive program
that is parsing the terminal datastream and feeding the extracted data
to some programmatic interface for direct consumption by another program,
then what you have is properly called a

These two types of programs share many properties, but calling them by
their right names avoids confusion.

One annoyance can be that terminal-emulation software does not behave exactly
the way the real terminal did.  One frustrated Usenet correspondent wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
...my experience with "VT100" emulators suggests that
many, maybe even most, lack some fundamental capability [such as] the
ability to respond to an auto-identification query, the ability to
perform certain screen or cursor operations, the ability to transmit
appropriate "editing keypad" escape sequences, etc.  Beware.
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

And he doesn't even mention the fact that the
<A HREF = "key_mice.html">keyboard</A> layout is almost always different.
</P>

<P>
A fellow where I used to work went through a great deal of trouble with
a well known, commercially sold emulator product.  However,
it turned out that the product was actually tested by the vendor only
against Unix applications that use "curses", so only the subset of
features that "curses" employs could be depended upon to work.  He
eventually threw the product out.
</P>

<P>
Therefore, when you are buying a commercial terminal-emulation product,
you may want to obtain some type of trial version, so that you can see
if it works well enough in your particular environment.
</P>

<P>
<I>
Or if you are writing a new emulation, don't test it only with "vi".
Even GNU Emacs would give your emulation a better workout!
But better still (for
<a href="dec.html">DEC</A> emulations) is

In today's networked world, 
<A HREF= "http://www.InstantWeb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=tcp%2Fip"

communication is ubiquitous.  This ubiquity has brought hazards along
with it: for interactive terminal sessions, the

Microsoft has been gradually improving the TCP/IP implementation in
Windows, but odd behavior sometimes is seen in interoperation with other
operating systems, and prudent users will need to spend some time
checking their

<I>Here I try to put a representative sample of terminal emulations
and information available freely or as 
<A HREF = "http://www.InstantWeb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=shareware"

sources.  These are of varying quality, but perhaps you will find some
of them useful.</I>

<I>Because of security issues, the "telnet" protocol should no longer
   be used, by itself, across the public Internet without encapsulation in
   some secure underlying protocol.
   Listed first below are software packages that provide better security and
   authentication via <A HREF = 
  "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~theom/riscos/crypto/index.html">SSH</A>,
   although IPsec or Kerberos may be more appropriate
   security mechanisms for large enterprises or widely deployed applications.
</I>

<P>

  SSH is often the most convenient tool for increasing security of remote
  connections, however, it is not perfect or foolproof.
  If SSH is deployed carelessly, security weaknesses may still exist in
  the connection setup, as discussed in

<H4>Regarding Methods of Emulating the IBM 3270</H4>

<P>
  <FONT SIZE="-0">
  Some vendors of terminal-emulation software for PCs and Macintoshes
  have been claiming to support
  <A HREF = "http://www.InstantWeb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=3270"
  >3270</A> terminal emulation--when what
  the product actually supports is mere emulation of a
  <A HREF = "televideo.html">Televideo</A>
  terminal with a special keymap that a
 <A HREF="http://www.InstantWeb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=protocol+converter"

  >EBCDIC</A> code translation and
  asynchronous/bisynchronous communication bridging.)
  In some environments, this
  setup is what you want, but sometimes you want these functions handled within
  the PC--as other products do.  Just be certain of what you are getting!
