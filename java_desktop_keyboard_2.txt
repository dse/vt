   Got my keyboard working, not really sure how
   After installing Solaris 10 3/05 and JDS 3 on a headless E450 I
   experienced the exact problem described in this post. I tried
   connecting using both Exceed and VNC and was not able to enter text
   from the keyboard after starting a JDS session. Now I am able to enter
   text, but unfortunately I'm not sure which change fixed the problem so
   I'll list the changes I made that may have had an affect. Since, the
   keyboard is now working I am not able to test these individually.
   1. I noticed that I had inadvertantly left my .cshrc file owned by
   root. I fixed this.
   2. I logged into the server using CDE rather than JDS. While logged
   into CDE the keyboard worked fine.
   3. I opened the Launch/Preferences/Desktop
   Preferences/Keyboard/Behavior window and unchecked the Repeat Keys and
   Cursor Blinking check boxes, then closed the window.
   After making the changes listed above I was am able to enter text into
   multiple applications while using JDS. I'm not sure which, if any, of
   these changes eliminated the problem.
   I have also notice an error message each time I log in now. It says
   that the wnck-applet has unexpectedly quit and is then followed by:
   "The panel encoutered a problem while loading
   OAFIID:GNOME_ShowDesktopApplet Details: Unknown CORBA exception id:
   'IDL:omg.org/CORBA/INV_OBJREF:1.0'

   I am having the exact same issue trying to remotely login to a
   headless Ultra10 running Solaris10 build 74 (JDS- When logging into
   CDE...no probs).
   I have tried the suggestions in these replies but to no avail.
   It seems to be an incompatability between the kb extension and gnome
   as the dt session log states:
   Window manager warning: Log level 32: could not find XKB extension.
   Yet my Xsun process seems to have the kb extension activated:
   /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -aud it 0 -nobanner +kb -auth
   /var/lib/gdm/:0.Xauth
   Are we any closer to this one yet?
   Cheers, db101

   I have tried at least 6 different X Servers on 2 different PCs so this
   is certainly not X-Server related, but is some issue in the JDS. I
   have installed the GA release.
   Cygwin Xwin gives some additional hints and also points at gnome being
   the problem, but Im no closer yet...

   This problem also occurs when connecting using VNC. I'd love to hear
   about a solution.

   Has this been logged as a bug, does anyone know if anyone at Sun is
   actually doing anything about this.
   I have been having the same problem with connecting from a few
   different Xservers.

   I have the same problem with JDS3 on a SunFire E2900 (headless
   server). CDE keyboard works fine.
   I found out something interesting though. If you install Soalris 10 on
   a box *with* a head, the same keyboard problem occurs until you log in
   *local* which then does something to make remote XDMCP access work
   from then on too. Of course, on a headless box this simply isn't an
   option.
   Please post any patches to this thread!

   I tried this on an ultra 5 and it still doesn't work.

   I've found this on SunSolve today and it's work:
   A workaround is to log directly on the sparc machine (or remotely via
   a CDE or failsafe session).
   run gconf-editor and remove all key defined in
   /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings
   Then remotely login in a JDS 3 session, the key grab won't happen.

   I've unset the values, it create a file %gconf.xml in the directory
   $HOME/.gconf/apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings
   The file contains the following lines:
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <gconf>
   <entry name="volume_up" mtime="1110896708" type="string">
   <stringvalue></stringvalue>
   </entry>
   <entry name="volume_mute" mtime="1110896705" type="string">
   <stringvalue></stringvalue>
   </entry>
   <entry name="volume_down" mtime="1110896702" type="string">
   <stringvalue></stringvalue>
   </entry>
   <entry name="help" mtime="1110896698" type="string">
   <stringvalue></stringvalue>
   </entry>
   </gconf>

   Hmm, when I run gconf-editor it fails to build the directory structure
   you discuss. I must have some permission problem. Can anyone give me a
   hint?

   i just created the structure and then added the lines posted in the
   %gconf.xml file... seemed to work... however, this is still a bug, i
   cant imagine having to do this for every user

   It works for me, but do you have a link for the sunsolve article I had
   already looked and found nothing.

   These workarounds have not solved the issue for me. Even if they did,
   they are just workarounds, and not something we want to implement
   across hundreds of users.
   I have lodged a case with SUN support and I will report back on
   progress and a bugid as soon as I get one.
