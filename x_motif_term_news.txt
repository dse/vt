Below is a summary of the information I received on X terminals.  Thanks to
all who replied.

From: kem@kato.prl.ufl.edu (Kelly Murray)

Info on the NCX line of X terminals:

It's URL: "file://ftp.netcom.com/pub/ncx/home.html".
Sometimes the netcom ftp server gets swamped, so keep trying.
If you don't have a WWW browser, you can simply anonymous ftp the files
in ftp.netcom.com:~ftp/pub/ncx/*.html.

From: John Dorn <nordgraf@utcc.utoronto.ca>

John recommended HP, TEK, and NCD as the ones to look for.  He mentioned
HDS as a low-end monochrome option, but wasn't sure of their quality.

The onces to avoid are Visual, DEC, and IBM.

He also has a  friend who is selling some TEK 19" colour 1280*1024
with 4 mb memory used 12-18 months under light usage.  You can probably
pick them up for under $2000 with a TEK warranty.  Contact John if you
are interested.  His friend has 200 available.

-----
The rest of the information I received was from friends as Georgia Tech. 
The College of Computing recently purchased X terminals for their grad
students so I received some good pointers.

NCD, HP, and Tektronix were again recommended.  Also recommended was checking
out a magazine called OpenSystemsToday which apparently advertizes alot of
X terminals.

Contact info:

NCD -- (404)424-0905  The person to talk to is Ken Pischke.

Tektronix -- (407)660-2727  The person to talk to is Jim Miller.

SUN -- (404)901-6910  Talk to Dan Streuber...he may not be exactly who you
       need to talk to but can point you in the right direction.

HP -- (404)246-5216  Talk to Olen Leonard...again may not be the right person.

HDS -- (800)HDS-1551

The 404 number are our local contacts...you might be able to get other 
numbers through those.

-----
From the data I have gotten, NCD is the best company to go for.  They 
apparently have the widest range of products and good prices.  I just 
compiled all of this info and have yet to call these companies.  I will
do so tomorrow (Friday) or next week.  Hopefully this has been useful
to you.

Excerpts from the OpenVMS FAQ: see    http://eisner.decus.org/vms/faq.htm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECW5.  Problem - the DELETE key deletes forward instead of backward!

This has to do with Motif's virtual bindings.  When a Motif application starts
up, it looks at the vendor string returned in the display connection
information and attempts to match the string to a table of virtual bindings.

You can override the default bindings in your decw$xdefaults.dat file. Here is
the entry you would make to get the default VMS bindings.

*defaultVirtualBindings:\
 osfCancel      :               <Key>F11        \n\
 osfLeft        :               <Key>Left       \n\

        This would usually be called "multi-headed" mode and
        the different screens would be addressed as "myhost:0.0"
        and "myhost:0.1" -- "myhost:1.0" and "myhost:1.1" (etc)
        would refer to a different server or instance running
        on the same machine.

        I don't know what this means on other forms of Unix
        --- but I think you'd usually see it on a system that
        was hosting multiple X Terminals via XDMCP.  On my Linux
        boxes I usually see it as an extra instance of the X server
        running on a different virtual console (so my wife and
        I can each have a running copy on any of the systems 
        around the house without having to disturb the other's).

        In our case we run startx -- :1 to start the 2nd instance
        of our X server.  We can then switch between them with 
        the [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Fx] sequence (or the [Alt]+[Fx] sequence
        to get to either of them from any of our text mode virtual 
        consoles.  (If you don't use a PC Unix that supports 
        VC's this probably won't make any sense -- don't worry 
        about it).

        Getting back to multi-headed support:

        This depends on your X server. Last I heard XFree86 servers
        (the suite of X servers that's most commonly used with Linux
        FreeBSD, NetBSD (PC) etc) don't currently support 
        multi-headed operation.

        I know that some of the commercial X servers for Linux
        (and presumably FreeBSD, etc) support it.  Unfortunately
        I've never used a PC or Mac Unix that was configured 
        this way.  So, I don't know how it works.  I've used an
        old Sun system set up this was --- but I didn't configure
        it or even look at it very closely --- it was just used
        for some compatability at a place where I was working,
        so I barely touched it.
        
        I've used Macs that were multi-headed.  That was a piece
        of cake to configure.  I also noticed that Win '98 has
        this feature available --- so it might become much more 
        common in the next year or so.

        Anyway, check out the XFree86 FAQ at http://www.xfree86.org/
        for more pointers.

Try the following :
-  on your HP box, start a X Font Server (in /etc/rc.config.d/xfs, set
   the variable RUN_X_FONT_SERVER=1)

-  configure the font path of your X Server to use this font server (it
   is possible with X-Win32 since I use this functionnality)

This will probably solve your problem (I had exactly the same problem as
you). This is due (I believe) to the fact that CDE uses HP specific
fonts that are not available except using the X Font Server.

I hope this can help you. Regards.

You might consider instead running the font server from inittab.
That way when it crashes (have they stopped crashing) it's restarted
right away and your terminal never knows the difference.

Hi All, When you install Exceed V 6.X it will prompt you for the
fonts to use.  You need to add the HP 75dpi and 100dpi fonts when
Exceed is installed on you PC.  This should get CDE to display
correctly.

I also use the Font Server and it must be set up on the HP first
before you add it to the Exceed configuration.  After your Font Server
is up and running:

1) Open Xconfig
2) opens the Fonts Icon
3) Select Font Data Base
4) Select Add
5) Enter tcp/your.host.name.com:7000   -   (This assumes that your font Server
   is using port 7000 which is the default)
6) Close out all the windows by selecting Ok or close.
7) The next time you try to Log into CDE it should get the right fonts from
   your X Server.

Hope this helps,

I was able to get mine to work by changing X Selection Associated With

on Exceen on the task bar, choose Edit -> Paste to X Selection -> From 
Clipboard and it works using any of the Paste option.

In article <C3F519.9tM@ireq.hydro.qc.ca>, ratel@ireq.hydro.qc.ca 
(Gilles Ratel 8720) writes about a problem getting a DECwindows Motif program
written in Fortran to work.  I contacted Gilles offline and helped him out;
for others' benefit, I'll detail what I found.

The first problem was the result of common and understandable confusion as
to how to translate C-style argument passing mechanisms to Fortran; there were
levels of address indirection included which were not necessary.  There is
a manual in the DECwindows Motif document set which discusses "non-C bindings",
but some simple rules are generally all that's needed:

	1.  If the C argument type isn't documented with an * next to the
	    type or argument name, and it isn't a string or a routine, then
	    it's probably passed by immediate value using %VAL.

	2.  If it's a string, it wants a null-terminated string passed by
	    reference.  For filling in "arg lists" with predeclared strings
	    of the XmNwhatever form, use %LOC(name); the strings are already
	    null-terminated in DECW$MOTIF.FOR.  If you're passing a string
	    as an argument to a routine, use %REF.

	3.  If it's a routine you're passing, just declare the routine
	    EXTERNAL and pass it directly; no %LOC.

The second problem was a generic Motif misunderstanding.  Gilles was asking
for the callback routine to be called when a SingleSelection occurred, but
the default selection type for a list widget is not SingleSelection (I think
it's ExtendedSelection, but I'm not sure).  Specifying single selection as
the selection policy when the widget was created fixed that problem.

I disagree with Brian McMillan's remarks on how difficult it is to do
Motif programming in Fortran.  It may be a bit confusing because of the
C bias of the Motif documentation and most of the examples, but it's fairly
straightforward to figure out how to use Fortran instead.  There are two
Fortran Motif examples provided on the DECwindows Motif toolkit which can
be very helpful. 

I've attached my corrected version of Gilles' program with some annotation.

You don't *have* to use C to program for X if you are willing to do a little
extra work.  One day I received yet another book-club mailing that listed four
Unix books and four X books under the heading "Unix", decided I wasn't going to
take it any more, and wrote my first X app.  Here it is:

You already have the former, assuming that you've got MOTIF installed:

(you can vary formating options with the /OPTIONS qualifier.)

SHIFT-F11 == Shift<Key>Escape.

Remove this line and you remove the window menu popup "feature".

Ah, that must be the problem.  NCD17c version 2.2.0 doesn't seem to

Sorry, but neither statement is true.

Upgrading from 5.5-2 to 6.1 is supported and works.

Motif has never been included in VMS.  What was included was DECwindows
(based on XUI, not Motif).  If you wanted Motif, you had to get it separately.
As of V6.0, the old DECwindows is no longer available and you must use
DECwindows Motif.

We stopped using Zinc, because it doesn't allow you to take control of the
X event loop, which is really important if you are building applications
that require the integration of several expert systems, and are distributed
processes.  There were also a lot of problems with positioning text in dialog 
boxes, ie if you resized the dialog the text would position itself in weird 
places.

Google it.

Your system must use either xdm or kdm as a X login manager. Both have
functionality that enable X terminals to login remotely.  Check their
man pages.

for xdm, changes in:

  /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config (check if DisplayManager.requestPort is not set
                           to 0 to disable listening for XDMCP)

are usually needed to support XDMCP.

I beleive kdm use the same files but they might be elsewhere. (or they
might be directly linked to the xdm ones.)

I believe, nowadays, people use the X kit made by Cygwin on Windows:

    http://x.cygwin.com/

Not that I ever used it. I only use Windows when I have no other choices
and try to keep it to minimal usage.

Also:

Running an X session remotly is very demanding on the network. It's only
recommanded over a local network.

Usually, you can get by with just running the X application you need
(with an appropriate DISPLAY variable). (lbxproxy can make X
applications fast enought to be usable over an internet connection too)
