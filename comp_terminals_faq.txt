What DIP switches?  Do you mean the SETUP switches?  Here goes!

comp.terminals unofficial FAQ
==============================
19-DEC-1991 Modifed Q. 2 (Interesting DEC escape sequences)
		Added d) (printer on/off)
22-NOV-1991 Added Q. 7 (Concept 108 baud rate)
20-NOV-1991 Added Q. 6 (VT125 setups) and changed Q.1 to point to Q.6
 1-NOV-1991 Added Q. 5 (cursor on and off)

1) How do I save my VT100 setups? -- see question 6

2) What are interesting DEC escape sequences?
a) ESC [ ? 5 h   :(white on black) or ESC [ ? 5 l (black on white).
b) ESC [ ? 6 7 l :to make <=] send DEL; ESC[?67h to make it send BackSpace.
c) ESC [ ? 2 5 h :Cursor visible; ESC [ ? 2 5 l   --- Cursor Invisible
d) ESC [ <nnn> i :Printer control, possible <nnn> values are
		  0=print screen 5=turn on printer controller 4=turn off..
		  ?0=print graphics screen ?5=turn on auto-print ?4=turn off..

3) What are the DIP switches for an H19 (or Z19)?

	    0 cursor is 0=underscore 1=block
	    1 keys 0=will 1=wont click
	    2 lines 0=wont 1=will wrap

Q: How can an application set the Backarrow (the key at the north east
side of the keyboard which is supposed to erase the previous char.
The icon on it is something like <=] partkey of vt320 to send backspace? DEL?

A: Send ESC[?67l to make <=] send DEL
   Send ESC[?67h to make it send BackSpace.

The following CSH script in unix may turn useful for switching
between the two modes.

	if ($?DEL) then
		stty erase "^?"	
		echo "[?67l"
	else
		stty erase ""
		echo "[?67h"
	endif

5) How do I turn my cursor on and off?
	ESC [ ? 2 5 h   --- Cursor visible
	ESC [ ? 2 5 l   --- Cursor Invisible
    Many "ANSI" terminal implement this, including all DEC VT100 and
    higher, the Kermit terminal emulator, etc, but not all.

6) What are the VT1xx setup items?
    Storing SETUP -- go into SETUP-A mode and press 'S'
    Recalling SETUP -- go into SETUP-A mode and press 'R'
    Resetting to factory default -- go into SETUP-A mode and press 'reset'
    Screen brightness -- go into SETUP-A mode and use up/down arrow keys.

    SETUP B
    Bank 1
	Scroll is 0=jump 1 =smooth
	Auto repeat 0=off 1=on
	Screen background is 0=dark 1=light
	Cursor is 0=underline 1=block

    Bank 2
	Margin Bell is 0=off 1=on
	Key click is 0=off 1=on
	Terminal is a 0=vt52 1=ansi (vt100)
	Auto XON is 0=off 1=on

    Bank 3
	Character set is 0=us 1=uk
	Auto wrap is 0=off 1=on
	Line feed/new line is 0=off 1=on
	Interlace is 0=off 1=on

    Bank 4
	Parity sense is 0=odd 1=even
	Parity is 0=off 1=on
	There are 0=7 1=8 bits/char
	Power supply is 0=60 1=50 hz

    Bank 5
	Reserved = 0
	Aux. Port has 0=7 1=8 bits/char
	Aux port speed is 00=300 01=1200 10=2400 11=9600
	Aux port speed second bit

7. How do I change the baud rate of my Concept 108 terminal??
   
    According to the manual...
      3.Display the status line by typing the STAT key.   If the
	termina is not in Remote mode (Field g), select Remote mode
	by typing the two keys MULT CODE 9.  If the terminal is not in
	Programmer mode (Field h), select Programmer mode by typing
	the two keys MULT CODE U (note - upper case U)
      4.Select the appropriate duplex setting (Field c).  The factory
	default is Half Duplex.  If this setting is correct proceed to
	step 5.  Change the duplex by one of following [sic] two key
	sequences:
		MULT CODE 8 (Full Duplex)
		MULT CODE * (Half Duplex)
	Hint the following manufacturers are usually Half Duplex ....
	[list of bankrupt manufacturs follows]
      5.Select the appropriate parity setting (Field e).  The factory
	default is noe (not parity bit is sent).  If this is
	correct proceed to step 6.  To change the parity type one of
	the following three key sequences:
		MULT CODE P Space (none)
		MULT CODE P !     (Even)
		MULT CODE P "     (Odd)
		MULT CODE P #     (Mark)
		MULT CODE P $     (Space)
      6.Select the appropriate Baud Rate setting (field b).  The
	factory default setting is 300 baud [!]  If this setting is
	correct proceed to step 7.  To change the Baud Rante type one
	of the following three key sequences:
		MULT CODE O Space       50
		MULT CODE O !           75
		MULT CODE O "           110
		MULT CODE O #           135
		MULT CODE O $           150
		MULT CODE O %           300
		MULT CODE O &           600
		MULT CODE O '           1200
		MULT CODE O (           1800
		MULT CODE O )           2000
		MULT CODE O *           2400
		MULT CODE O +           3600
		MULT CODE O ,           4800
		MULT CODE O -           7200
		MULT CODE O .           9600
      7.Select the appropriate stop bit setting (Field d).  The factory
	default setting is two stop bits.  If this is correct proceed
	to step 8.  To change the number of stop bits type one of the
        following four key sequences:
		MULT CODE Space < !     (One stop bit)
		MULT CODE Space < "     (Two stop bits)
	Stop bits are usually set to two for baud rate of 300 or
	below and otherwise are set to one.
      8.Once you have achieved communications you can store these
	setting permanently in the terminal by typing the three
	character sequence MULT CODE Space C

IBM 3270 is not an ASCII terminal -- there is no possible termcap entry
for it.  It is not at all related to IBM character-oriented terminals.

"3270" is the name of a class of terminal devices which use a packet-
oriented protocol (called, naturally enough, the "3270 data stream") for
commands and use EBCDIC for character codes.  It's more like a network
device than it is like a regular character terminal, such as a VT100.

This stuff should be in the FAQ.

Yep, and it's also worth mentioning that tn3270 (a telnet command that
makes 3270 datastreams usable from a ASCII character-oriented
terminal) and 100% compatibles are freely available for a number of
systems (including C source for Unix, Macintosh and MS-DOS).  Check
archie for details by searching for "3270".

>This stuff should be in the FAQ.

Yes, it should be, and if there's not an FAQ already I'll start one.
