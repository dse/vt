I have placed all but two of my VT100 Pics at WUARCHIVE in the
/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS directory. (I couldn't find another one to upload to)
They are called *.ANS.  (For ANSI)  Most work fine, some are really 
pathetic, and some are pretty neat.  

(That's wuarchive.wustl.edu)

This is a pet peeve of mine.  PC users call their proprietary graphics
character set "ANSI".  It's not, though.  I suspect that it got the
name "ANSI" because the driver you sometimes load to emulate a broken
terminal is called "ANSI.SYS".

There is no such thing as "ANSI" graphics.  All graphics character sets
are proprietary, and DEC's is called "VT Special Graphics."  No, they're
not compatible, though a translator could be hacked together.

I have no first-hand knowledge of Telix or "telemate", but my vague
impression is that they perform the small subset of the standard "ANSI
X3.64" which Microsoft supported in the MS-DOS ANSI.SYS console driver,
plus displaying the line-drawing and poker-playing character glyphs
that IBM made common in the IBM PC.  Although popular in the dial-up
BBS community, these line-drawing characters differ from the ones that
you get in the DEC VT100 and its successors.  None of them appear, to
my knowledge, in any publication from ANSI.

(There is also some kluge for making the ANSI.SYS driver play music,
but the Escape sequences for this cause most other terminal emulations
to behave in unpredictably bad ways.)

So, look in an IBM PC hardware technical reference manual, or some
similar reference, to find these so-called "ANSI graphics".

While we are at it, I'll hint that anonymous FTP to "cs.utk.edu"
enables one to look in "pub/shuford/terminal", where some data reside.
