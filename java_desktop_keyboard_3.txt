   If you copy that file to relevant place in
   /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults it will work for other users.

   I tied it and it does not work for me...
   even the path
   "$HOME/.gconf/apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings"
   desnt even exists.

   Same here, and creating it with the file inside has not worked for me.
   I get the following error on login:
   Error activating XKB configuration.
   Probably internal libxklavier or gnome-settings-daemon problem.
   X server version data:
   The Cygwin/X Project
   60801000
   If you report this situation as a bug, please include:
   - The result of xprop -root | grep XKB
   - The result of gconftool-2 -R /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/xkb
   The output from the above xprop command (run by ssh'ing to the system
   and redirecting X to a local cygwin X sever on the PC):
   _XKB_RULES_NAMES(STRING) = "xorg", "pc105", "us", "", ""
   The output from the above gconftool-2 command is:
   layouts = [us]
   model = pc105
   overrideSettings = false
   options = []
   Perhaps the problem is something to do with xkb thinking its a xorg
   server rather than the SUN X server - not sure why the xprop output
   has xorg in it - x86 uses xorg, but not the SPARC version.

   Interestingly, when the screen is locked, I *can* type in my password
   to unlock it - but then the keyboard stops working. I also note when
   going to the menu and selecting logout, the bottom panel stop
   responding.

   After some testing I think i've got it, it works for every user i've
   tried.
   Create the file :
   /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/%
   gconf.xml
   Put in it :
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <gconf>
   <entry name="volume_up" mtime="1110896708" type="string">
   <stringvalue></stringvalue>
   </entry>
   <entry name="volume_mute" mtime="1110896705" type="string">
   <stringvalue></stringvalue>
   </entry>
   <entry name="volume_down" mtime="1110896702" type="string">
   <stringvalue></stringvalue>
   </entry>
   <entry name="help" mtime="1110896698" type="string">
   <stringvalue></stringvalue>
   </entry>
   </gconf>
   Can anyone test this on a different machine. I've tried it on my Ultra
   5 and seems to sort the problem on new and existing users.

   This is quite intresting..., this folder did not exist in my $HOME,
   and even by creating it, with this %gconf.xml, the problem was still
   there....
   But, when I change
   /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/%
   gconf.xml with the values described..., I still receive an error
   message, but the keyboard works!!!

   Hi There,
   I just tried this on my older sun box (clone - Dual Ultra Sparc II -
   400Mhz) and this worked like a charm. When I tried making these
   changes through the gconf-editor (to unset the keybindings) it would
   never set properly.
   This has done the trick!
   Thanks!

   Indeed, this also allowed me to login and use the keyboard, however I
   still get the xkb error on login. For a completely fresh, new user,
   this appears 8 times, thereafter on each login only once.
   I still have the problem of the logout option not working. It simply
   hangs the "Java" start here button - is anyone else experiencing this?
   My system is a V440 with 03/05 on it.

   I agree, what a shame for SUN to release a new version of OS and have
   such a big bug, and the worst part is that they dont seem to care
   about it.
   The workarounds do not for for me either.

   I think they do care, but it appears no one has taken the time to
   lodge a bug! I am now in touch with a SUN engineer who is working the
   problem, bug id: 6177509. I will let you know the outcome.

   I also tried your workaround and it still works! I have a SF 280R and
   connect with Exceed to the machine... thank you very much
