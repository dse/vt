Using keyboards with Palm or other Handheld "Personal Digital Assistants"

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

To salute our "video terminal" motif:

one idea that might occur to Palm owners is to try hooking up both a GoType
keyboard and a modem to their Palm device, so as to create a pocket-portable
VT100 terminal emulator.  Alas, with the standard Palm hardware products
available in the spring of A.D. 2000, there is only a single serial port,
which the keyboard and modem cannot share.

However, you could obtain a PalmOS-compatible TRGpro handheld computer and use
a modem in the Compact Flash (CF) slot, following a hint from another web site:

        http://www.landware.com/gotype/faq.html

        40. But you don't understand, I really really want to go online with my
        GoType! Pro and modem.  Is there anything I can do?  I'm desperate and
        will do anything!

        TRG sells a PalmOS compatible organizer which sports a CompactFlash
        slot.  Since the CompactFlash slot is separate from the serial
        port which connects to the GoType! keyboard, you will be able to use
        both at the same time.  Check out the TRG website at

I use my Visor with the Handspring modem and GoType keyboard quite often.

The reason you can't do IR and serial concurrently is that there's only one
UART shared between the two ports. The Handspring modem has its own UART.

No. The serial interfaces are not compatible.

I got an of idea that would work. See this page on my rather new website.
I came up with an idea last night.

    http://www.ncf.ca/~de351/PalmHard.htm

Basically it looks like it is feasible to make a keyboard adapter thingy that
let you have an external keyboard and talk to the serial port at the same time.

I am looking at this as a hobby hardware project right now. I can see some
marketing potentials. There are probably potential markets to fix the problem
for existing products. Note: It would need some additional hardware.

This seems to be a design overlook among a few minor things. The daVinci was
actually designed with a separate keyboard interface.

This _might_ work for sending which is something, but you will
very likely get trouble with reading input from the keyboard,
since the keyboard will probably not store your key-press
until you release the RS-232 port. It will probably either drop
the button presses or it will try to send it anyway.

Alan, it could very well be a hardware problem. BUT! If you haven't done
it already, go download the updated driver for the keyboard at
http://www.palm.com/support/downloads/kb_driver.html

The driver you need is "keyboard1.1.zip" (Windows) or "keyboard1.1.sit"
(Mac). You'll see it towards the bottom of the page, labeled as a Beta
version. It's well worth the little bit of time spent to do this update.

I wouldn't be too concerned with durability.  I've had mine for almost
a month with no problems.  I use it every day, I take it to all
meetings, so it's getting folded and unfolded a dozen or so times a
day.  I even dropped it yesterday and no ill effects.

It strikes me as a very well constructed device, and much easier to
type on that the GoType!.

I highly recommend the PPK.

Mark, et. al.

The PPK was designed to meet all of the durability requirements of notebook
computers. The keys will last a minimum of 7 million cycles, as they are the
costly scissors-type mechanism found in the best notebooks. The product can
be opened and closed tens of thousands of times, more than the number of
cycles a notebook lid is designed for. It was designed to pass extreme
temperature testing and drop testing. Hundreds of units have been tested the
equivalent of ten years or more of use with virtually no failures. Palm has
very stringent requirements which this product meets. The keyboard is
constructed out of aluminum and special plastic similar to what is used in
notebook computers. The flexible circuits are designed to flex the
equivalent of at least 10 years use as well.

Just some food for thought.

Jim


  [Archiver's Note:

   The Think Outside firm makes the folding keyboard,
   also known as the "Stowaway", sold by Palm as the PPK: see
   http://www.thinkoutside.com/pr022200_2.html

   This equivalent product for Visor seems to be sold by Targus.

Sorry, I don't have a Stowaway keyboard but I like my GoType a lot
and it is significantly cheaper, especially when you factor in the
free word processor and thesaurus that comes with the GoType.

Another option to consider is the Happy Hacking Cradle that lets
you use any PC keyboard.  I have one of these too and it is pretty
sweet.  It is also much cheaper than the folding keyboard.

Can either the Visor or the TRGPro work with both a keyboard and modem
symultaneously?  It looks like it's possible to connect both, but
there have been issues in the past with PalmOS devices only supporting
one device at a time.  E.g, most devices couldn't do IR and Serial
communication at the same time (except for ones with the PIII IR
upgrade card).

Has anyone tried it yet?

Did a bit more experimentation. Looks like most of my problem is due to
using TakeNote! with the PPK.


Command-<accelerator>, where <accelerator> is the key associated with a
menu option, works. The big problem with TakeNote! is that it uses
1,2,3,7,8,9 as accelerators for cursor movement -- go to top of document,
that sort of thing. These are mapped by the PPK keyboard driver to switch
to the Palm's built-in apps (which isn't totally stupid, but due to a
bug in TakeNote! on the Palm IIIc causes fatal exceptions that need a
reset to get out of).

Some way of moving around the menus (using the arrow keys) would be rather
useful, for example for getting at menu items with no defined accelerator ...

The original driver is at fault.  There is a beta driver that everyone

From what I have read, this is a limitation of the PalmOS.  It was developed
for pen based input... unfortunately the only way to access some menu
commands is to tap on the array of pixels after hitting menu.  The only
workaround is to memorize the command letters... IE hit the CMD key and D
will initiate the delete command.  Of course not all menu options have
corresponding CMD letters.  So keep your stylus handy.

I reloaded with the most current driver and it works perfectly.  I love this

Notice that the page says it supports "any PS/2 interface 101/104
keyboard with power consumption less than 5V/50mA."  I hear many
standard keyboards exceed consume more power and don't work.  Their
own Happy Hacking Keyboard does work, of course, but for the price of
this combination, I think you can get that fancy folding keyboard
(Palm Portable Keyboard).

Personally I went for a GoType! keyboard instead.

It took me a surprisingly long time to get "good" at Fitaly. For

How good are you at Graffiti? I know there are some people who
just never get the hang of Graffiti. If you're comfortable with
Graffiti, at the level of text entry you do, Fitaly probably
won't be of great benefit. If, on the other hand, you find
yourself trying to use the built-in keyboard, you might as well
get Fitaly and take advantage of its strengths.

Fitaly's advantage is that (once you get the hang of it) it's as
fast or faster than Graffiti and far superior to the QWERTY
keyboard for stylus input, and definitely better than the built-
in keyboard for any kind of input.

Hope this helps!

The so-called FITALY arrangement is so named for the same reason
that QWERTY is called what it is:

The "keyboard" is either displayed on the screen (as in PocketPC
implementations) or pre-printed on a plastic-coated overlay that
is stuck on over the Palm's "Graffiti" area. There is also a
displayed-template version for Palm machines, but it uses a hack
that only works on monochrome Palm PDA's.  The version the
requires the pre-printed sticker is called "Fitaly Stamp". When
you buy it, it comes with about 4 stickers, so you can replace
worn-out ones. Additional stickers are available separately.

The central arrangement of little squares looks like this:
(fixed-pitch font recommended)

    z v c h w k
    f i t a l y
        n e
    g d o r s b
    q j u m p x

The two "gaps" in the middle row act as dual "space bars". The
idea is that most common characters are grouped around the middle
of the array, with less-frequent characters situated further out
at the edges. Also, common letter sequences tend to require
minimal movement to go from one letter to another.  For example,
the word "that" is formed by poking letters in a tight little
triangle.

Capital letters are formed either by use of a "shift" pad at the
edge or by sliding the stylus a certain amount after tapping a
letter. Shorter slides are used to enter foreign-language
characters with accents, umlauts, etc. Slides can also be
customized to enter other characters or common words and phrases.

Further to the left and right of the "letter square" are other
squares the produce numbers, special characters, and other
controls. To make room for all this, the standard four icons at
the corners of the Graffiti pad have been moved into a tight
little column at the left, and the PalmOS hacked to make this
re-arrangement work. There is a spot you can tap to toggle
between FITALY-mode and Graffiti mode, if you wish.

The arrangement is patented by the company that makes it,
Textware Solutions. Their literature says that it was the product
of computer-analysis of letter sequences to produce an optimized
arrangement, although I think they favored the arrangement that
also produced easy-to-remember letter sequences such as Italy,
Jump, and Do(o)rs.

They advertise that you can do 50 wpm with practice. I've only
managed to sustain about 30 wpm so far, but that's still quicker
than Graffiti, and a good deal more accurate. The record is
something over 80wpm by a hot-shot who undoubtedly practiced the
test sentence unceasingly until he could do it in his sleep.

(BTW, for the "Palm-illiterate" the term Graffiti refers to the
system of "writing" movements normally used to enter characters
into a Palm-OS PDA. It's a whole subject unto itself.) Some of
the newer PalmOS machines have dispensed with Graffiti and have
opted for little "thumb keyboards" in the standard qwerty
arrangement. I imagine that those work best for people with small
thumbs. Never tried 'em though.

Some people have started wearing little "stylus rings" that you
wear on the tip of your index finger like a guitar pick. In
general, sharpened fingernails are not recommended, because you
can scratch the plastic screen overlay.

You can download a demo, if you have a Palm or PocketPC (Windows CE) PDA.

There are a number of high quality telnet clients available for the Palm

TakeNote that comes with the gotype is very good for what you've
described, I use it in the same way you've described. If you're only going
to be typing on flat surfaces, get the palm folding and buy takenote from
landware or another similar program, such as pendit. I have the gotype
which is more suitable for my purposes working on airplanes, trains, and
on my lap, but the palm is more compact which may be important if you're
carrying it around campus, although the gotype is also very portable. On
the other hand, if you're a student and looking for the best value, the
gotype with the free software, which includes a thesaurus, is 70 bucks
while the palm is 100 and the takenotes program purchased separately is
another 40, so effectively it's twice as expensive. If you're a good
typist, you'll likely type just as well on both keyboards. The gotype has
full sized keys, they're just spaced a little closer together, while the
palm has full sized keys that are arranged in the size of regular
keyboard. Unless you have fat fingers, you'll quickly adapt to the gotype.

You didn't mention whether size or weight factored into your travel
plans, but also consider that you can charge and HotSync your Palm V
through the GoType Pro keyboard, eliminating the need to pack the
HotSync cradle.  You will still need to carry the Palm V AC adapter and
a serial cable.  The last I checked, this wasn't possible using the Palm
folding keyboard.

The full-sized keys of the Palm folding keyboard are nice, though,
especially if you're going to do lots of typing on a stable surface.

Subject: Pal Portable Keyboard

My long awaited PPK arrived last Saturday.  It is not often that a
purchase exceeds my expections, but this one definitely does.  I did not
expect such a crisp key action--I can just go like a bat out of hell on
it.  I thought my GoType had pretty good action, but in comparison, the
GoType feels like a wet sponge.

I'm keeping the GoType; there are occasions when I need to be able to
type comfortably with the keyboard on my lap.

My only complaint, and technically it can't really be a complaint about
the keyboards, is the incompatibility between Palm and Visor.  Now,
because of the keyboards, when my old Palm Personal (upgraded to Palm
III) drops dead, I will be forced to buy another Palm instead of being
in a position to compare Palm and Visor and make a decision.

I've spent a couple of hours poking around the net and come up with a
partial answer: use a non-existent <cmd>-<character> chord, _then_
press the key for the shortcut you want. For example, press <cmd>-`
(the backquote/tilde character, to the right of the space key). Release
it, and you'll see the little command popup at the bottom of the screen;
hit "1" to go to the top of the document in WriteNow!, or "9" to go to
the bottom of the document. Whereas pressing <cmd>-1 will helpfully
bounce you into some other application ...

To say this is counter-intuitive is an understatement: this user
interface feature ought to be taken out and shot.

The Palm OS doesn't support those kinds of keyboard actions.

See: http://www.targus.com/faq_detail.asp?sku=PA800U#420

Use shortcuts instead (which can be activated by the keyboard).

I've also just made a quick-and-dirty Dvorak version of the driver for
the Targus Stowaway Keyboard for the Handspring Visor, which is
essentially the same keyboard (although the driver appears to be rather
different).

Dear Dave,

The 3c10317u is the latest revision of the Palm Portable Keyboard which
allows usage with the m100, Palm III series and Palm VII Series, while
the 2410439u is the older revision that only allows usage with the Palm
III and VII Series.

Along with my modem slight misadventure, the other item I bought from
Computers4Sure was a Landware GoType keyboard.

Well, I didn't get a GoType keyboard for the Palm III - I got a GoType *Pro*
for the Palm III/VII series.

The GoType Pro for the Palm III/VII isn't even listed on the Landware web
page.


It has a serial port on the left side (and they also supply a cable) which
allows you to hot-sync with the Palm in the GoType cradle now and it also
has a charge plug on the right side for the Palm V and IBM c3. As with the
other GoTypes, it includes TakeNote and WordSleuth.

Of note, you can't sync and type at the same time and have to slide a little
switch to select GoType mode or hot-sync, but no need to carry around the
cradle if you carry the cable.

I'm a very happy camper!

It's also $54.99 at Computers4Sure - an excellent price.

Yup, a very high WOW factor. I do a lot of catching up on my notes at
Starbucks--or at least I try to. More often than not, I end up doing a demo
for someone when they see what I'm doing.

I don't do many meetings where I need to take notes, but just lately I've
had two of them where I got to whip my little setup out of my bag and type
to my heart's content. I loved it! I actually made it home with notes I
could understand after-the-fact. The only problem with the whole experience
was that the meeting was stopped twice because the person speaking wondered
if he'd said something funny. Nope, I just had been unable to keep from
grinning my stupid head off at the idea of finally being able to use the
Palm/Keyboard in a for-real meeting.

Subject: Wild Shortcuts / Palm Keyboard?

Hi All,

Anyone else see the following problem:

The symptom is that every once in awhile the Palm does about a dozen
backspaces.  This can be annoying, especially with terse notes.

It occurs only when the Palm Portable Keyboard Version 1.2 driver is
enabled; then every 16th shortcut entered with the stylus causes a dozen
backspaces.

The shortcuts have to be stylus entered (not KB entered) and active
shortcuts.  That is, if shortcut-X is not defined, it doesn't count toward
the 16 trigger-count.

If the KB driver is not enabled, no problems.

If the KB driver is enabled for 12 shortcuts, then disabled for any number
of shortcuts, then re-enabled, the backspaces will happen after 4 more
shortcuts.

The problem is independent of editor (MemoPad, QED, etc.) and Hackmaster
(all hacks disabled / enabled).

The KB driver is very slick and smart about detecting when the Palm is
placed on the KB.  But the occasional dozen backspaces are so aggravating
I've taken to enabling and disabling the driver each time.

I posted a report to Palm's tech support site a couple of days ago, but no
results yet.

Thanks for the responses; and of course ya'll are correct.  The Targus
fold-up keyboard does work with the Prism.

After looking that a picture of the Targus keyboard on their web site, I
went to CompUSA yesterday and checked it out. They had a display keyboard I
tried on  both the Visor and Prism - it worked just as everyone said.

Afterwards, I gleefully bought a Prism and the keyboard.

I really like my Palm V, but the Prism is going to be a lot easier on these
old eyes.

Another respondent recommended that I check the Targus web site for the most
current driver - on my way to doing that now.

Again, thanks to everyone for the info.

This is a common and frustrating problem for several posters.   It was one
of the problems I was having with the Palm Portable Keyboard I returned to
the store.  I thought it was a hardware failure in some lots of Palm
Portable Keyboards.

But where exactly are you referring to?  In Preferences/Connections there is
a list of Available Connections.  They are:

Palm Modem US/Canada
Palm Modem UK
IBM WorkPad Modem
Direct Serial (Set to "Serial to PC")
IR to a PC/Handheld
Pretec 56K CF Modem
Direct CF Serial

It's Preferences/Serial/IR where the choice is Cradle or Infrared. I
suppose this isn't present in all OSs. Mine is TRG's 3.5.1.

Just to eliminate possible misunderstandings: I'm not talking about
Hotsync's own settings; it's under Preferences/Serial/IR,

I've seen that others have found other remedies for the same symptom.
Maybe the general problem is that the keyboard driver sometimes is too
slow to take over the hotsync signal from the keyboard. What do I know?

It appears when you install the irenhanc update from 3com's site on
OS's before 3.5.2. That's the one you need to get an IR Hotsync working
properly.

Ah, I suspect that's the problem, then. Delete the IRenhance (it isn't
needed with OS 3.3 and above) and the original conflict should go away.

You're absolutely right. This option belongs to IrEnhance used
especially for communicating with Ericsson phones. It seems this is now
redundant, but I haven't been able to delete the files yet. They're said
to be in ROM, but they're not.

You may need a warm reset (up-arrow and reset pin) first to disable the
file so it can be removed. If it still resists deletion, you might want
to try Z'catalog. It's among the best in letting you get "under the
hood" to tweak the file attributes and surgically remove offending
files. If *that* doesn't work, the offending files may have been written
to flash ROM. If so, you may need to use FlashPro to remove it.

That was a somewhat wobbly answer. If its a system enhancement resisting
deletion, a warm reset is the only way to prepare it for deletion
without wiping all via hard reset, either from the system delete menu or
via tools like Z'Catalog. Getting "under the hood" with Z'Catalog does
not give you the ability to unhook system enhancements. The IR
enhancement extensions are *very* unlikely to reside in FlashPo Flash
space, they don't hook in from there and used to provoke a crash last
time I tried this on an OS3.0.

Well, thanks for the gratuitous review of my answer, Erwin, but what you
suggest is exactly what I said, "wobbly" or not:

First, a warm reset to disable the file. Even disabled, some files will
resist deletion by the system utilities, so an enhanced utility is the
next step. I agree that it's unlikely that the enhancement was written
to flash memory (though this was, in effect, what was reported by the
error message), but in the event this was so, FlashPro should be able to
take it out.

Problem is, I've already tried doing a warm reset first. It didn't
help. Neither the generic launcher nor DBExplorer nor Filez nor Zarf
can delete it. Hard reset seems to be the only way left.

Subject: Problems with using Portable Keyboard or Beaming with AfterBurner
    3.0t ---Please Help

Hi all,

I originally thought that I was having problems using my portable
keyboard or beaming because of Launch'Em 2.16. However, I am also
using AfterBurner 3.0t along with X-Master to manage my hacks. I've
recently narrowed down the problem to AfterBurner. If I try to use my
keyboard, my Palm attempts to connect to my serial port for what
appears to be a hotsync. If I try to beam information, I simply hangs
at the screen that says "Beam....Searching" until I cancel it or it
times out. I have found that merely unchecking the AfterBurner still
does not solve this issue. I have to uncheck AfterBurner to disable it
and then do a soft reset and then all is well.

Is anyone else experiencing this??? Is there anything that I can do??
I don't mind having to disable AfterBurner if it's absolutely
necessary, but I'd prefer to not have to do a soft reset also. Any
ideas or fixes out there???
Thanks in advance!!!
Regards,
Steve B.

Many overclocking programs also speed up serial connections in a
a non-standard way.  Since your Hotsync cradle, keyboard and any
IR recipients are set to do serial communications in a standard way,
it's not going to work correctly.  You may need to switch to an
overclocking utility which allows you to select which apps will run at
normal speeds, or which automatically throttles down when any serial
device is in use.

One warning--I have found that the switching back and forth between
fast and slower speeds for serial communications can destablize a Palm
like nothing else, even to the point of requiring a Hard Reset and
restoring of your entire Palm's contents.  BackupBuddy is *essential*
if you're going to experiment with these types of programs.

Folks,

I've found that mine adapts to the flat surface after a short while and
then is very quiet and nice to use.  By the way - if you have one of
these, you should download the latest driver update from Palm.  It makes
the keyboard much more responsive, and doesn't lose any characters at
the beginning of your typing session (as mine did earlier - I type
pretty fast).

Any Tungsten with a universal connector should work.  The Tungsten E will 
not, because it only has a mini-USB connector and can't connect to any 
peripherals except via IR.  Make sure you get the latest keyboard driver and 
install all the updates for the Palm you buy.
