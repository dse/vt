 ANSI standards do not define the specific outputs of Function Keys,
 but they do define the Control Sequence Introducer part of the outputs.

 A Function Key which outputs an ANSI standard sequence would output

     Esc [ ... ~  (7-bits)
 or  CSI   ... ~  (8-bits)  where Esc = 1B hex and CSI = 9B hex,
                            ... = unique key code, ~ (tilde) = terminator

 Example: VT220,VT320,VT420,VT500 output for UnShifted F6 key is:

           F6  = Esc [  17 ~  (7-bit controls)
           F6  = CSI    17 ~  (8-bit controls)

 VT500 terminals have added more factory default Function Keys by
 extending this ANSI standard pattern of outputs:

           F6  = Esc [  17 ~
     Shift-F6  = Esc [  17 ; 2 ~
   Control-F6  = Esc [  17 ; 5 ~

 Because the outputs follow a standard pattern, an application which
 parses ANSI sequences can distinguish between the different Function Keys
 as well as terminal reports.  As you can see, "; 2" and "; 5" provide
 a separator and a modifier parameter which can be parsed.  Of course,
 many applications are written to be 'hard wired' to a set of Function
 Key outputs as it is easier to write code which detects a specific
 pattern vs taking time to generalize input processing, but the terminal
 does send an ANSI standard sequence.

 ANSI standards do not define a standard for the output of a particular
 Function Key.  One ANSI terminal (emulator) may output:

            F1 = Esc [ R

 and another:

            F1 = Esc [ 11 ~

 The only thing you can count on is that that sequence of data will
 start with "Esc [" or CSI.

 ASCII terminals (emulations) output unique (non-ANSI) sequences for
 Function Keys.  Example: F1= SOH @ CR  where SOH = 01 and CR = 0D hex.
 The pattern is vendor specific.

 As you can see, this causes a lot of the confusion associated with
 making a terminal "work" with a particular application.  The end user
 just wants to press "F1", as she has been instructed and she does
 not need or want to know how the terminal is signalling the host.

 Recognising that most people are not aware of the above issues and
 are just trying to adapt the terminal to the existing application,
 we included an on-board Define Key Editor in VT500 terminals.  This
 feature allows any key on the keyboard to be redefined to output
 what the host/application requires.

Actually, they use the same large DIN connectors as old Wyse terminals. I 
see them in many places (public library) and the dimensions are the same.

A normal PC keyboard definately does not work. It's a loaded 10-pin DIN 
and about 1 or 2mm larger than a PC 6-pin DIN connector.

:-(  Looks like I'm sol.

They're unnecessary in Linux, which will let you modify the kernel

  No tilde?!  You must have the ill-fated 100-key keyboard instead of the
101-key!  If it's a PC, you can try pressing <Alt> and holding it while
typing 126 on the keypad (NOT the number keys above the letters).  When
you release the Alt key, a tilde should appear.  Good Luck!

I had the same problem with true dumb terminals, not emulations.
I don't remember the details, but we found several workarounds:

1) try to use h, j, k and l for cursor movement instead of the
  arrow keys,

2) See if the Unix administrator can provide for a time delay after
receiving ESC.  I don't remember if this was a system-level setting or
a user option for vi.  It causes the host to wait for more
incoming characters before acting on an escape.

3) change your terminal emulation setting to send ESC [ A instead
of ESC O A.  Better yet, use 8-bit control if you can, so the
emulation will send #8F=SS3 instead of ESC O, and #9B=CSI instead
of ESC [.

  No matter how fast Kermit sends the characters, if you go through
protocol translations on the way to your host, the ESC may get
split into a different block from the rest of the command, and the
arrival times may exceed the host's delay time.  If you set the delay
time really long, it will take a long time for the 'naked' ESC for ending
input mode to be acted on.  You may include your edit keystrokes as text.

(We were first using Televideo 955 terminals, and the arrow keys sent
control characters.  Then we got Beehive vt100 clones and started seeing
this problem.  Our resident Unix guru worked the details.)

A real terminal keyboard is, unlike a PC keyboard, rather robust. Many
years ago a colleague of mine spilled coffee into a keyboard. We
turned it upside down to let the coffee run out and let it dry for
24 hours. It worked fine afterwards.

I would not recemmend that exercise, if you use sugar in the coffee !

Oh, and a follow up... I just received my adapter from Sun Xpress...
And you do not need the Sun keyboard in order to do an L1-A.

They map the PAUSE key on the PS/2 keyboard to be STOP, so you can use
PAUSE-A and get the same results..

Just thought you'd like to know.  The converter is really nice, and is
going to make my job that much easier since I won't be stuck on these
Sun type 4/5 keyboards any longer...  Bleh, as if Sun knew what
ergonomic meant!

Now I just gotta figure out how to make Solaris 2.5 switch the Control
and CapsLock keys.  I tried doing it while using the type 5 keyboard
plugged into the adapter but it didn't work...  I'll have to see what
the PS/2 keyboard does, and I believe there was something about
switching the Control/CapsLock somewhere in the Solaris 2.x FAQ... I
*like* my Control key next to the A... :)

While we are on the topic --- has _anyone_ ever succeeded in getting
a keyboard out of Wyse that has the key mechanics of the Wyse60 terminal
keyboard (or similar; Well, you know, this _real good_ keyboard ;-), but
a PS/2 or AT connector?

That's the only keyboard I can think of that I like even better than
the IBM I am typing on right now (with a spare in the cupboard ;-),
and I have been trying to get one for years. So far, the only outcome
has been A$300 wasted on a Wyse keyboard that turned out to be rubber
and graphite. GRRR! I have even considered buying a Wy60, putting at a
standard serial port.

A few time ago I asked if connecting a pc keyboard on a WY120 through a
home-built interface was possible. Steve Bell told me no and I thank Mr
Bell for his answer. I have to tell you I'm not very familiar with the
terminals specifications, in fact, it was the first time I saw one.

Well, I just get a LK201 Keyboard. As the modular jack connector
perfectly fits in the WY120 monitor, as a completly newbie, I plug it
in, and, as I do expect, that doesn't work.
If anybody out there has an idea on how to build an adapter to make the
LK201 work with the WY120 Monitor, maybe this guy can help a stupid
french student to make his WY120 work....

I'm still sorry for the mistakes and for my weak english.
Thanks !

Different voltages, signal encodings, pinouts; there is no way the would
have been compatible, and of course it is impossible to adapt one to the
other.

Welcome to the wonderful world of terminals.  Where no two manufacturers
could agree on a parts, specs (hardware) or configuration (again hardware).
I won't even go into the world of terminal program encodings (just look at
a circa 1990 BSD termcap file sometime).

What you are going to find, is that even though these manufacturers liked
the idea of a modular plug for their keyboard connector (in some of their
terminal models -- they aren't even consistent and compatible with
themselves):

        A Wyse keyboard will work on nobody but the same vintage Wyse
                terminal (different models are incompatible with other
                models, even though the keyboard look the same and have
                the same plug);

        A DEC keyboard will not work on anything but a DEC terminal and
                a DEC Rainbow computer;

        A Link keyboard will not work on anything but a Link terminal,
                however they did used to market Wyse replacement keyboards
                that would have a switch on the bottom to switch it from
                Wyse pinout and signals to Link pinout and signals;

        Same true for Hewlett-Packard, Alloy Terminals, Data General,
                Computer Consoles (CCI), Vector Graphics, TeleDyne,
                Prime Computer, and so on;

        An IBM AT or clone 101-key keyboard could not be used on an IBM
                PC/XT or clone, but the PC keyboard could be used on an AT;

        The above two 5-volt keyboards could not be adapted to the 3-volt
                IBM PS/2 and most modern Intel-chip clones, but recent
                keyboards from clone vendors since about 1990 work on both
                3- or 5-volt system, mini-DIN or regular-sized-DIN.

Basically, except in the PC market, you can't mix different vendor's terminals
and keyboards -- except where it is sold as a direct replacement.

Somebody is going to have to be kind to you and send you a working Wyse
keyboard.

Note: Looking at voltage pins, I think you blew out the DEC keyboard.

| Would a Wyse 60 keyboard work properly on a Wyse 150 terminal? 

From time to time, somebody pops up in "comp.terminals" and asks
if Wyse keyboards are interchangable between different models of
terminals made by Wyse.  Not having access to lots of different
Wyse models, I don't know if you can use a Wyse 60 keyboard with 
a 150.  And I'm not sure if you can extrapolate compatibility     
of that relatively older product from the characteristics of 
newer models. Perhaps you can try it and report back what happens?

Sun SPARC-based systems are designed to be configured headless (using
a character-cell console terminal communicating with the A serial port
at 9600,8,N,1 by default) while yet allowing operators to do this.   

Traditionally, the "Break" condition on the RS-232 serial line is
used to signal the OpenBoot PROM monitor to seize control from the
operating system, just as if you had typed Stop-A (or L1-A) on a  
directly attached Sun keyboard.

I think that Wyse terminals have a "Break" key that generates the
the RS-232 serial "Break" condition.  Press that key, or perhaps 
Control and Break together, and you should get the "ok" prompt.  

(The serial "Break" condition is a voltage level held for a certain
length of time; it is not an ASCII character. Also, it is not the  
same as Telnet's "break" signal, unless some terminal server
translates it so.)

A problem arises with serial Break:  voltage glitches from merely
unplugging the terminal's serial cable can *also* produce a serial
Break condition. Sometimes this has mystified system administrators,
not understanding why the machine suddenly dropped into PROM mode,  
suspending all other processing.  (They could recover from this, if
they knew to merely type "go" to the "ok" prompt quickly enough.)  

Therefore, Sun invented an "Alternate Break sequence" that can be
configured on the machine to avoid this voltage-glitch problem.  
By default, the Alternate Break sequence is a 3-character sequence:
Carriage Return, Tilde and Control-B [CR ~ CTRL-B].  For information
on how to set it up, read the following man pages from a recent
release of Solaris:  kbd, zs, se, asy.

An additional safety measure on all of Sun's newer enterprise-class
SPARC servers is a key switch on the frontpanel that enables or
disables the console-Break function.

the "system terminal setup" page of [this website] and see also

According to the WYSE keyboard/terminal cross-reference list, it should:

    http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/Keydetl1.asp?Q=18&R=3

Everything seems to be compatible with either all three of the 120/150/160,
or none of them.

If you're doing a serial console, sending a "break" should work.  Haven't
gotten my terminal to function well enough to confirm anything yet.

Yes, it works!  Thanks for the info, Peter.

If you connect to several OS flavors you need to be aware that most
of the commercial OSes do not recognise a TERM=linux which is what
the Linux consoles are by default. 'xterm' is widely recognised but
most commercial versions chose to have backspace and delete behave
differently than the default Linux behavior (long religious war has been
fought about it, both sides have agreed to disagree).                           
You might have fewer problems to trace down by using 'screen' as your
"universal emulation" until you gain a better understanding.

'screen' reads and recognizes your local keystrings and then sends the
vt100 or ansi settings, I forget which (they are almost identical).

To explain a bit(leaving out lots) of terminfo:

Each terminal type has a file with its "characters sent when pressed"
and its "operation performed when these characters are seen" compiled in
to the, typically short, records.  You can see the one for your current
TERM setting via the 'infocmp' command.  Here is what I get:

The group in the middle which starts with 'kbs=\177' and ends with
'kspd=^Z' are the sequences sent when you press the corresponding key.

To be able to deal properly with all these key definitions and
terminal control sequences the target machine needs to have
a compiled definition file in /usr/share/terminfo/l/linux or
/usr/lib/terminfo/l/linux

You can create a 'local to your home directory' temporary workplace so
you do not chance screwing up system-wide by:

        mkdir ~/terminfo;export TERMINFO=~/terminfo

Then with the command 'tic linux.def' or whatever filename you give
the above output to you create the ~/terminfo/l/linux entry which your
current shell will use till you logout or reset the TERMINFO value.

The longer names and the function they are tied to can be found in
'man 5 terminfo'.

Enough for now.  More later if you want.
