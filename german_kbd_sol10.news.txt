There are some isses with this, I believe.


I think this happens when you run Xorg.  The workaround is,
I believe, as follows:


	- exit X
	- login on the command line
	- run kdmconfig, select Xsun
	- select the appropriate keyboard layout and devices,
	  exit saving changes.
	  (this should have fixed the OS settings)

	- run kdmconfig again and reselect Xorg


There might be a way to do this directly with "eeprom".
