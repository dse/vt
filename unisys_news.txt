A division of Attachmate Corporation makes products emulating Unisys
terminals.

[Unisys, if you didn't hear, was formed from the merger of Burroughs
Corporation and Sperry Univac.  Attachmate is similarly the result
of vendor mergers: KEA Systems and Digital Communications Associates
(DCA) are two of the predecessors.]

Terminal emulators include InterCom. for Unisys T27 emulation
(available for Windows, Macintosh, DOS, and UNIX), and PEP for UTS
20/40/60 emulation (available for Windows, Macintosh, DOS, and UNIX).

For information about product part numbers and suggested retail
prices, telephone the Attachmate Unisys Division at +1 513/745-0500.

Core Technology is pleased to announce its presence on the World Wide Web.

Core Technology has been in the Unisys business for over fourteen years and
has offered "best of breed" terminal emulation and file transfer (FileSWEEP)
products for the A and V series mainframes on Windows, DOS, and Macintosh
platforms.

Core Technology recently announced the availability of a break-through 
offering called MultiBridge.  MultiBridge is a gateway offering based on 
Novel's IPX/SPX protocol.  It allows for a choice of multiple high-speed
protocols.  MultiBridge also eliminates the need for NetBIOS, which frees
users to run multiple platforms on a gateway.

Sorry, they will do you no good unless you have a Unisys DCP (or GCS/CTMC)
since they are synchronous terminals using the Uniscope protocol. They will
not work with an asynch system.

Greetings!

I've just had 1/2 dozen of the following fall from the sky into my
lab, and as it happens, they have not the required paperwork (auughh!)

I would like to connect these to either (or both of) a DEC microVAX
(old - about the size of a refrigerator, also inheirited, and in to
process of being properly identified as well) or an intel box running
Linux, SCO, or QNX (whichever I feel most happy with, as I am
evaluating the 3 of them concurrently -- and then must decide on
either Ultrix or VMS for the uVAX).  Hrrrumph.

Please be kind and aid this unfortunate human with a proper
identification and whatever specs you might be able to reliably
imagine.  Each unit has 2 parts: a video screen, and keyboard.

There are ports on the rear of the video unit for the keyboard
connection (9-pin, a la atari-2600 joystick), one marked J5
Peripheral, which I assume is for a printer (DB-25) and J6
Communication (DB-25), which I assume is for a serial link to the
intended host.  

Green monochrome character terminal, 80x24 +2 fixed status lines at
the bottom.  Lower right-hand side indicates "Sperry UTS 30".  Tags on
the underside declare the following:

Video unit:
	FCO Status Record Type / Feature 3575-01 Serial 18230
	Built by Gene 09/84
	Feature Selection Label		Type #357599000
	CS	/	NXXXX
	C		3381-00				Keyboard unit:		FT18
	C		4084-00				55-03047-053	7/86
	F		3980-00				2836974-25
	F		3981-00				F4725-25
	F		3988-00
	F		3982-00
	F		3991-00
	F		8217-01
	
Once powered on, the display indicates the following on the 24th
display line (note <tc>= triangular-shaped character):
	
	<tr> UNISCOPE MODE (F3991-00)   READY  - 3R3E 00 <tr>

25th line is a row of dots, which I assume are delimiting the terminal
area.  Beginning at the left margin of the 26th line is 

		1 ROW-01 COL=01

which changes accordingly as I move the box-shaped cursor (which has a
diagonal line through it, as opposed to being solid inverse-green)
around the screen.

Other questions:  how might I identify if the communications port is
synchronous (in which case I believe I would be knackered?).  Is there
a key-sequence to enter some sort of configuration mode on the unit to
specify terminal settings?  Any information at all would be helpful,
really.  And if you happen to be responding to this because you have
one (or more) of these beasties, I'll repay you with a keyboard for
them, since I have 6 extra with the lot.

Sperry, I understand, merged with Unisys some time ago, and their
telephone girl didn't seem to be of much help in deciding where to
send me for help.

Thank you kindly for any assistance you may be able to render.
It would be most advantageous for you to follow-up via e-mail to
rob@oxford.net in addition to a posting here.

Kind regards,

Well, I'm from the Burroughs side of the house, but I fooled with Sperry
terminals for a while so I will give some of the basics a shot.

The thing is a "Sperry Uniscope Terminal" that speaks Uniscope protocol.
This is a polled, block-mode protocol.  The host sends out a terminal address
with "do you have anything interesting" and the terminal responds with "no",
or a whole boatload of data.  In general the terminal sends all the characters
to the right of the last one of those little triangular characters, up to
*and including* the character currently under the cursor.  Lacking any of the
field separators on the screen, it sends from the first character to the
cursor.

Unless there is a configurable "tty mode" (which I kinda doubt on a UTS-30,
you can't make it send one character at a time, as you are used to with
VT-100 terminals.

Uniscope protocol was typically a sync protocol, often at 9600 baud.  The
baud rate will be configurable in some way, and sync/async *may* be
configurable, or may require a hardware option.  There is a mode configuration
page where many of the options are set, but I forget how to get to it at
the moment.  Others will doubtless tell you how.

I believe the "1" at the front of the status line display is telling you
the page number that is visible.  These terminals often were configured
with two pages that could be displayed.  Each page had its own terminal
address (unlike Burroughs TD series terminals).  Typically, the first page
was used for terminal session data, and the second page was used for data
sent to the attached printer, although this was by convention and it could
be used just like the first page.

You should be able to order a manual for at least a UTS-40 from literature
distribution.  While some of the details will be different, it will give
you the basic operating characteristics of the box.  I believe that it also
describes Uniscope protocol and the rather odd pinout on that DB-25
datacomm connector; but that may have been in another manual.  Unfortunately
all my Sperry DCP info is packed in a box where I can't get to it easily.

Hope some of that helps.  (Also hope I didn't tell you any lies!)

	Loren

Detlef,

      in separate response thread,Ron Smith & Keith Stone gave you some good
info about UTS. Your post talks of an "existing UTS Host" - what do you mean?
Are you trying to use a UTS terminal to talk to a Unix box? The other thread
suggests that.

A thought occurs to me. The terminal in question wouldn't be a UTS-10, would
it? If I remember rightly, that was Sperry's first attempt at an Asynchronous
terminal, and strictly speaking was NOT a UTS in the normal sense of the term
at all. If that's what it is, it's probably pretty close to a basic VT-style
ASCII terminal. Also, I think the UTS-30 intelligent terminal could be
persuaded to behave like an async terminal if you hooked the comms line to the
printer port and used the "Print" key instead of the "Transmit" key.

But all other UTS terminals use a Synchronous comms discipline (called
"Uniscope protocol" after the earliest terminals that handled it) which would
be humongously difficult to handle from an async machine.

The emulators that Ron and Keith speak of are to make a PC (or other
intelligent workstation) appear to be a UTS terminal, but are specifically and
only intended for use where the eventual host is a 2200 (or other ex-Sperry
machine). In most cases, these emulators no longer even use the original
Uniscope hardware connection wires (long outdated), but go over TCP/IP or some
such instead, thus embedding the screen control part of Uniscope protocol into
a completely different messaging envelope.

I hope this is some use to you; feel free to email me for more if you wish. I
did once write a "reverse emulator" for a Uniscope on the 2200, using CS-1100,
so I had to delve quite deeply into this area.

UTS terminals cannot simply be entered in a Unix definition file.  They use
a polling protocol and sophisticated screen handling with features quite
different from those in DEC VTxxx type terminals (not necessarily better,
just different).  It is most like an IBM 3270 running in block mode.

The UTS terminal protocol is really a 1972 version of the ANSI standard
block mode terminal, but no one else ever implemented it.

There are UTS terminal emulator products available for Windows and most
Unix platforms from Attachmate and other companies.

There is an older manual that provided the full UTS protocol stack
including screen formatting.  A complete implementation in C would be
50,000+ lines of code.  Hopefully, your problem is small enough that you
only need to implement a subset.

The manual is UP-10683 Rev. 1 published in 1988.  The title is "Uniscope
Protocol Reference Manual."  See your Unisys representative and ask to
order a copy of UP-10683.R1.

No, what you need is the ability to emulate the *screen commands* of the
UniScope terminal.  You don't need to worry about syncs and all, you're
concerned with cursor motion, protect/unprotect, SOEs and FCCs.

That's pretty well documented in the UTS books.  I'd be surprised if
there isn't a "gateway" that maps all of that good stuff to a VT-100-ish
protocol.  (Though I doubt a "real" vt-100 has enough intelligence to
fake the UniScope's features without a *lot* of intelligence in between.)

Mind you, QNX is gonna be a big pain with this.  I hope you've coughed up
enough cash for their compiler ('cause you ain't gonna have a choice!).

Are you running a 2200 ?  I do not know what is an SVT1120, but if it is
a Uniscope type terminal, I suggest to check how they are configured on
the host or DCP side : are they configured as "multidrop" (I if
remember the word correctly) ?  I believe they should be, as the MSD
is probably not aware of the Uniscope protocol...

You have two ways to configure several drops of Uniscope terminals,
depending on how they are connected.

If they are connected via a Multiplexor aware of the Uniscope
protocol, the Mux will help the host or the DCP, and you must
configure the host or DCP so that it is aware of that.  if the MSD
does not have that capability and the host expects the MSD do have it,
I expects problems.

We use a B39 with TCP/IP in our network, however, we have no Mac
machines.  We do have Unisys U6000(UNIX), Sun, Linux, Windows NT, and
DOS/Windows machines and they all communicate well with the B39. We
use the Ethernet slice product (B25-EN3) with a tranceiver connected
via coax.  The software products we use are the Unisys
TCP/IP(NP25-TCP) and IDMSS(MB25-IDM--required to run the slice)
packages.  The TCP product comes with the usual utilities such as FTP,
Telnet, etc.  We have also tried the Unisys NFS package.  This worked
OK on CTOS-III but was not supported on the older BTOS O/S where we
really needed it.  The TCP/IP stuff worked on both O/S versions.
While the performance of the B39/TCP setup doesn't compare to the
other machines on the network, it gets the job done for us.

From what I've been told, there are better performance software
products out there.  An outfit called Sirus Systems (+1-804/733-7944)
has TCP/IP & NFS products for CTOS which they claim outperform the
Unisys offering.  However, my guess is that it's the Ethernet slice
configuration more than the software which is the culprit.  I know,
it's a 386--what do I expect?

I hope this helps. Good Luck!

Paul

To all those who have sent me mail on this subject--it was easier to

The product is 9635-01 for DCP5/200, 9635-00 for all other models.

It is a DCP product that allows a DEC VT100 dial-in terminal to use
full-screen UTS products; the drawback is it is difficult to print the
screens due to the VT100 control codes.  Refer to document Software

I have talked with my program manager who is getting the definative

SNA Envoy "MT" emulator for 3270 connections.

This is an *updated part* of the SNA Envoy product.

When we introduced TN3270,
we created a style so that you can just order the MT Emulator for
Telnet TN3270.  SNA Envoy can use the updated MTE2, but Telnet
*requires* the updated MTE2 to work.

Telnet (in DSSSUPPORT) links BYFUNCTION to MTE2SUPPORT.  Appliction
output in received by Telnet.  Telnet then calls MTE2 to "translate"
to 3270.  The result is then written to the Port.  Client input is buffered by
Telnet until EOR.  MTE2 is called to "translate" to MT.  The result is
then sent to COMS (or whatever MCS the dialog is established to).

Subject: Re: UTS emualtors

Tony,

Not satisfied with products available on the market and with the need to
communicate from Windows NT Servers to OS2200 TIP sessions, I decided to
write an UTS emulator myself.

Currently the program consists of a DLL that implements the INT1 protocol,
a OCX that provides UTS terminal functionality and a Container Application
that allows to call the OCX standallone.

Current features are:

Limited emulation of UTS400 UTS20 and UTS40 terminals. Connects over TCP to
HLC and DCP but only to TIP applications.

At our company we use this tool to connect our TIP users, wich is the wast
majority. We still use Infoconnect or simple Telnet for Demand sessions.

I tried to make the emulation as simple as possible. That is: No remappable
Keyboard, no customizable toolbars or scripting language, no complicated
setup etc.

But because of the Emulation built in an OCX (nowadays called ActiveX
control), its fairly easy to write a container app around the OCX, that
provides specific features for the application environment.

drop me a line, if you are interested in a copy.

STEP was a product from Master link for SPERRY UNIVAC (now Unisys) UTS20
UTS 40 and UTS 60 emulation

        Master Link was acquired by Computer Logics, who was acquired
by CHI, who was gobbled up by DCA (IRMA for IBM folks), who was gobbled
up by Attachmate.

        The product is still alive as "INFOCONNECT", from ICC
(Cincinnati, who was gobbled up and merged with CHI , etc.

At least one of them was B&W, and it was sloooooooooow. So slow that
Burroughs couldn't sell them, and resorted to supplying them as ODTs
instead. I was working for the State of Florida when Burroughs upgraded
our Conrac ODTs (I think they were still officially called SPOs). The
Conracs were horrible things with 40-character lines. We specified that
the upgrade consoles would not be TD860s, but Burroughs delivered
TD860s anyway.

On this terminal, if you put 24 CRs on the screen -- this was a time
when visible CRs were the norm -- all in column 1, and hit transmit, it
took the terminal about 4 seconds to analyze the screen and actually go
into transmit mode.

For this terminal used as an ODT, Burroughs implemented a system option
-- or perhaps it was a TERM option, I can't remember which, and it
seems to have been finally removed -- to send full-length lines, no
CRs, because the terminal was so slow to process CRs. It was quite
noticeably faster to send a full screen, without CRs.

The TD860 was also the subject of a CUBE Resolution -- submitted, if
memory serves, by Bob Dever -- which explicitly referred to it as a
boat anchor.

The Conrac (I thought those went away with the B6700) was the successor
to the B5500's teletype, as I recall.  SPO stood for "Supervisory Print
Out" or something, but it was easier to say then "ODT" so it stuck.  We
(University of Denver) kept a bottle of Windex (tm) or something to
clean
the ODT's, and one of the operators labeled it "SPO-Brite."

Burroughs had an interesting line of CRT's.  Anybody else remember the
BIDS?  24x80 display, 1000 bytes of memory, fill those and it beeped a
lot.

The TD830 was nice.  I wonder what went wrong with the TD850, etc.

DU switched to VAXes about the time Burroughs (by then Unisys, I think)
came out with the successor to the TD series (CT's?).  There we were,
back to hardcopy operator terminals...

Yes, that was a B6700 I was talking about. Kept it long enough to
replace the Conracs. I was one of those wearing a black dot at the CUBE
conference in Phoenix when Burroughs announced the demise of the B6700.

I think it was Supervisory Printer Output -- Print Out would be too
simple -- but hey. Funny thing is that Unisys has a new console called
SPO, except now it's Single Point Operations. It's been out a couple of
years at least, but I heard someone saying in Minneapolis that it still
doesn't really work with A-Series/NX/LX. Anyone using it? This is just
"heard in the hall"; I didn't get a chance to check it out. It's
certainly supposed to work with the A/NX/LX.

I like it.

Not only that, but you could put two screens on one 1KB controller,
giving 512 bytes per screen. However, that was "compressed": if the
message included tabs and CRs, they were stored in the display memory
and not expanded into spaces. Thus designing layouts to eliminate
extraneous spaces was important. Of course, COBOL wasn't good at
handling variable-length fields (COBOL85 is much better, but I'm
talking 1974, and that's real date 1974 not COBOL74). I took one
inquiry program that could not get all the standard information for the
reply in one screen and rewrote it in ALGOL, which could get it all 99%
of the time.

The BIDS had a beautiful display, better than anything since, because
the characters were actually drawn rather than bitmapped. Raster
technology won't match that until it reaches 300dpi.

> TERM FULLPAGE TRUE

Thanks for the reminder. Definitely not in the 45.1 System Commands
manual, so it's clearly been deimplemented.

I have no inside information, but that TD850 came along rather shortly
after the TD830. I suspect that they were both in development at the
same time, probably by different groups. Thus different managers and
different procedures, and also the TD850 didn't get evaluated against
the TD830 in time. Just guessing though.

Yes, you're right.  I misstated the lineage.  Rogue is the original,
and this was a manual rewrite of that.  Rogue was known as Hack by the
time I became aware of the Large Systems port.

Subject: Attachmate InfoConnect IDK for screen scraper?


  My company has purchased the Attachmate InfoConnect IDK for Windows 32
bit.

  It has become my task to take this IDK and develop an application that is
essentially a screen scraper for a Unisys terminal emulation running on an
NT workstation. I'm
hoping that someone can point me in the write direction and get me started.
I have almost no
experience with terminal emulation or mainframes.

  First of all, all of the samples appear to be for the old style 16 bit
windows and messaging system.

  This platform is NT and I will be using Microsoft Visual C++.
Can anyone provide a sample C++ code blurb that demonstrates some IDK
functionality?

-  If I assume that the Terminal emulation is already in place and connected
to it's respective Host mainframe,  I would hope that my application is
capable of capturing Screen activity
as well as initiating screen updates.

- Is the library and DLL enough or do I need to have the InfoConnect
Manager running?


-  Functionally what is involved in this process? (Something like this...?)

  Determine and somehow connect to the active terminal emulation session.
  Catch and interpret datastream from session.
  Build datastream to update terminal emulation session.
  Send it..


  Thanks in advance!

Subject: Re: Attachmate InfoConnect IDK for screen scraper?

Mark:

     I was formerly the Manager of Attachmate's Systems Engineers
(1991-1997) and used to work extensively on these products and kits. Unless
something has changed in the last 2 years (nothing I've heard would indicate
that) the information that I am providing should be accurate.

     First off, Attachmate offers 2 different development kits: IDK
(INFOConnect Developer's Kit) is actually a Unisys SKU and is the same
toolset that Attachmate uses to create the INFOConnect emulators (PEP and
InterCom). The other development kit is the ADK (Accessory Developers Kit).
The ADK is what you would typically use for screen scraping development.
Accessory comes from the framework that Attachmate uses to "plug in" various
emulators. When ICC and DCA merged in 1992 we noticed that Crosstalk had the
ability to become several different kinds of emulators, ICC took the
framework and adapted it for T27 and UTS functionality.

    If you are using the IDK, you will be in effect pulling the datastream
directly out of the communications module. Which means that you will have to
account for all of the various EOT and EOP and video characters inserted to
format the message for a screen. To do a simple screen scraping project, you
are dealing with a little bit of extra work AND have probably bought way
more than you needed. The methodology that you will employ is to launch
INFOConnect Manager, assign your application to a transport, begin listening
on the port, then start passing information back and forth (inserting all of
the screen code so that your mainframe application still thinks it's talking
to a terminal.

     With the ADK, you are in effect screen scraping and the methods and
terminology are fairly easy to work with. In fact we used to build demos
using nothing more than Microsoft Word and Excel. You are in effect doing a
HLLAPI connection (because of the differences with the 3270 this method is
called IHLLAPI) with the emulator. With that, you generally create the
application, identify the locations (on the terminal screen) for the data -
x,y coordinates and length, call a couple of ADK libraries into your app and
pass the coordinates in and then read the result set. The application is
assigned to a terminal session so once the application is launched it
launches the INFOConnect emulator, establishes a connection, and then waits
for your app to begin passing it info.  You don't worry about screen
formatting.

    In 1993 and 1994 I was working with a group within DCA that created an
screen scraping application called QuickApp that automated the mapping and
call process. We adapted it for T27 and UTS use and it can cut your
development time by half or more.

     If I were going to develop a screen scraping application, I would ask
about QuickApp first. The next product that I would ask about is the ADK,
the LAST product would be the IDK. That takes them in order of ease of use
and your apparent desired use. If they still offer the ADK, you were sold
the wrong tool for your application.

    I will forward an informational White Paper that I wrote a couple of
years back to explain the various development kits to the sales force at
Attachmate. I would call Attachmate and ask for verification (talk to an
SE--I would recommend George Swetzer or Guy DiSisto) that you are usign the
correct toolset.

Subject: Re: Attachmate InfoConnect IDK for screen scraper?

Mark,

What you need is probably the InfoConnect UDK or Quick App. Another
possibility would be to code against the IHLLAPI interface (which is an
IBM/Microsoft standard that makes your app more portable to other mainframe
terminal emulations (IBM 3270)).

Be warned though, We made extremely bad experiences with the stability and
maintainability of INFOConnect based applications. IMHO the INFOConnect
Architecture is overly complex for most situations and while newer releases
try to hide some of the complexity, you as a programmer still have to deal
with it to a certain extent. I assume you are going to build an app against
Unisys UTS (OS2200 / TIP). In that case I would suggest looking at other
products like Quickware (http://www.qw.com/) before you decide.
Especially if you are thinking about mass deployment of that application.

After struggling with Unisys/Attachmate for Years we finally threw
INFOConnect away and never regretted it. I developped an own locked down
INT-1 / UTS emulator engine which we use for Screenscraping/Facelifting that
is very easy to mass-deploy. Inhouse we use QTerm UTS which is IMHO a much
better solution than INFOConnect. Furthermore QW is dedicated to its
products, while Attachmate has a whole bunch of different Productlines, and
Unisys is only a small part of their business. Im speaking out of my
European experience, things might be different at your place though.

Contact me per E-mail if you need further advice.

Hi,

I work in emulations company, and we're going to implement the

I'm assuming you're willing to pay for the time...I kind of doubt anyone will

Subject: Re: unisys UTS terminal comparison

UTS40 had a very wide variety of monochrome highlight capabilities--15 or
more different combinations of intensity, reverse video, flashing, etc.

UTS400 was also monochrome, had less highlighting choices than a UTS40, but
had significant brains--it even had its own COBOL compiler. I think it may
have been CP/M again, but I don't recall for certain.

UTS60 had colour display (graphics as well as character), and was the basis
of MAPPER's colour display management; most OS/2200 PC-based emulator
packages you see nowadays are actually emulating UTS60. Funny enough, there
never actually was a 'real' hardware UTS60--even the one that was sold as
such was actually a CP/M-based microcomputer running a Uniscope emulation
program enahnced to do colour as well. You could escape into CP/M by pressing
Function-M, if I recall correctly.

If you hung UTS60s on the old MAPPER 5, you even had the amusing situation
of a terminal with a maximum main memory capacity 6x that of its 'mainframe'
driver.

Great information.

In terms of compatibility... I assume this means that the 60 supports
everything that the 40 does plus graphics.  What about the 400?

Where is this best place to find command/escape sequence and  protocol
specifications for UTS terminals?

No, the 40's monochrome capabilities were more sophisticated than a 60 had,
but it couldn't do colour character sequences, whereas the 60 could.

As Dan said, the best source is that manual.

I second this recommendation--I bought the book.  It does have some holes
(INT-1 & DCA aren't in there, and you have to already know the keyboard and
what the keys usually do), but it's reasonably complete regarding the
capabilities.  The UTS30 had personality packs, which allowed it to boot up
as a micro, a SperryLink, or a terminal.  It had line graphics which weren't
available on any other model (incl. the UTS60).

IIRC, it doesn't get into control page settings much.  I miss that; I can't
remember most of the more interesting settings (columns-per-page, default
colors, etc).

Some of the blink and reverse video options which worked well on the
monochrome terminals produces strange behavior on the colour terminals;
even the other models of monochrome weren't necessarily consistent when
you mixed blinking with highlight, etc.

DPS was great in terms of hiding terminal capability differences from
programs, but it was such an overhead beast I usually avoided it.  Always
avoided it, actually.  I supported it for the application community, but
never wrote a TIP transaction with it.  Too much baggage.  
Your Mileage May Have Varied.  (YMMV past tense).

And, having managed the support  and development of DPS 1100 from 1980
to 1990, I always recommend DPS even today.  It may have a bit of baggage,
but it masks the COMPOOL and MCB differences (or let you know them), and
it runs not only on any UTS, but on IBM 3270/Dataspeed 40s and now in a
Web browser with the Java features.  Go DPS !

DPS incurs a significant overhead, though, especially on the web browser 
side.  We've noticed a lot of savings in creating transactions that 
bypass that portion and just do pass-through text through WebTS.  To its 
credit, it does allow you to separate your presentation logic from your 
business logic, which is handy...  :)

I'm not saying I've never used it, or wouldn't use it in the future. 
However, I see its life span being shorter than other Unisys products, 
especially if they don't make it extended mode.

Subject: Re: unisys UTS terminal comparison

This is from memory so it may be less than 100% accurate.

The UTS 200 (or U200, can't remember) supported .esc. sequences to
move the cursor around - including direct row/col positioning--but
not *that* much else.  I think they may possibly have had
reverse-video, but the only way to have blinking effects was to use
one of two special 'blink' characters.

The UTS 400 was the first one to support FCC sequences.  These allowed
fields to be defined which could be protected, (high-intensity,
low-intensity, blinking) and maybe one or two options more.

The UTS 10, UTS 20 and UTS 40 came next.  They were pretty similar to
each other and substantially expanded the FCC (field definition)
possibilities.  Fields could be Numeric, Alpha, Alphanumeric,
Left-Justified, Right-Just and again, maybe one or two options more. 
There was also a transmit-setting called CHANge mode where only fields
which had been changed would be transmitted--saving a lot of network
traffic.  CHANge mode was/is used with DPS, normally under TIP.

The UTS 30 added graphics (?) and possibly more FCCs--it was a
powerful beast--the UTS 60 added graphics and colour.  I seem to
remember that the UTS 60 was missing some of the more esoteric
functions of the UTS10/20/30/40 terminals (possibly just those of the
UTS 30), which would have been the first time that functionality had
been removed.  Since virtually everyone was by now using DPS to
generate the sequences, this did not really matter because DPS could
recognise different terminal-types and generate the appropriate FCC
sequences for them.

As to documentation, each terminal-type had it's own user-manual.  My
old UTS documentation is at home so I can't say what UP 10683 R1 does.

I certainly cannot remember one manual being valid for all variations
but that does not have to mean that there was no such manual.

The UTS10 was a "glass teletype",  VT2xx type async terminal.

    [Archivist's Note:  The above "glass teletype" description is not how 
     persons fluent in DEC terminal technology would regard the VT220.]

  [snipped descriptions of different terminal types]

Don't forget the UTS 40 TE.  It was a special version of the UTS 40 with
extra features designed for text editing.  That was back when it was sort

I think that is right.  The protocol manual gave a lot of general
information but not some of the details of the some of the differences
among models.
