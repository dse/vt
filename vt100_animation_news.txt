Actually, there are public domain ANSI-animation programs often used by BBS's
for creating similar animations.

And the ANSI terminal specification is a superset of the common VT1xx
protocols.  I've tried using ANSI animations on my VT100 emulation program, as
well as on hardware VT2xx and VT3xx terminals around campus; they work fine.

Glenn, Hi!

The earliest copy of FILM that I have is from 1981, but others have also
responded to this. However, who out there ever used PECO (Picture Editor and
Corrector)? PECO used VMS libraries (xxx.PLB) to hold multiple frames and was a
really nice VTxx editor for moving images - it allowed dissolves, merges insets
and overlays. When I worked for DEC is was in the TOOLSHED (now the ASSETS
library), and, if anyone in DEC who knows about it is listening, it may be able
to be released into the public domain. PECO is in a league apart from FILM, and
is FAR more powerful. It has a Reference Manual of 160 blocks and a 483 block
function manual. Loads of features, loads of fun!

it (*.FLM).  FTP to HYLKA.HELSINKI.FI and cd to [.games-etc.film], 
there is also a *great* space invaders clone for vt100's and up in

Subject: gonzo.flm


Gonzo.flm was on an older RSX SIG tape and is a pure sequence of VT100
escape sequences. It depicts a "privileged user's first program",
showing a shooting gallery in which a PDP11 shoots down user
programs, but is bombed by the user program (which overwrites
APR 0 where RSX lives), resulting in a spectacular crash and
set of error "dumps" with some partial registers longer than
16 bits (neat trick on an 11) designed to make it look as though
the machine just crashed. 

   It was one of the tapes done back in the early 80s away from the
symposium; I remember how we all laughed at it. For awhile I used to
have the system set to type it whenever someone typed an erroneous
command. (*I* knew to use control-O).
