    Archiver's Note--Updated 26 September A.D. 2007

Sharon Industries is no longer in business.

|   Archiver's Note--Updated 23 February A.D. 1998
|   One concern that sometimes arises in the computer community during these
|   final years of the Twentieth Century is how to find repair parts and
|   maintenance information about the character-cell video terminals made by
|   Televideo Systems.  One frequently cited source is Sharon Industries of
|   San Jose, California.  As of [1998-02-23], I have verified that Sharon is
|   still in business and can still repair several models of Televideo (TVI)
|   terminals. However, Sharon may not have every manual for every model of 
|   terminal, so you should call by voice and ask what is available.
|   +1 408-436-0455

However, as of 2007-09-26, there is a corporate entity called "Televideo"
which can be reached by calling +1 408-954-8333.

I recently saw many postings concerning Televideo terminal switch
settings so I thought I would post this for the general public.
Televideo is still in business [as of 1991] somewhere just outside of
San Fransico, California.  They do have an 800 number which can be
obtained through directory assistance.  When I called them concerning
a question for a Televideo 910 terminal, they said that they no longer
service that line, but they could provide me with the switch settings
if I needed them.  They also gave me a number of the company which
bought the rights to maintain the Televideo 9xx line, and I was told
that I could order parts and manuals from that company.  I don't have
that number now or I would post it.

The following is excerpted from a letter I received some time ago.  I
hope it is helpful.

I used to work in a shop that had a lot of TVI-950s.  I believe the
design of the 925 is quite similar.  The 950s had a nasty habit of
blowing the video drive board.  There is a big electrolytic
capacitor that couples the horitonal drive to the yoke and flyback
transformer.  It has been a while, but my recollection is that it
is about 47 uF, 25 V, non polarized.  There is a current of
something like 3.3 aRMS flowing in that capacitor and it tends to
get rather warm and hence dry out and short.  Sometimes, the
horizontal output transistor and flyback are taken out when the
capacitor shorts.

We eventally dumped the 950s when it became difficult and expensive
to get the video drive boards.  I don't recommend that
inexperienced technicians touch the high voltage wiring.  On
older terminals, the anode lead to the CRT often gets coated with
greasy dust.  After using appropriate discharge techniques
(discharge twice, several minutes apart for safety's sake), the
wiring may be cleaned with alcohol.  There is probably anti-corona
paint on the CRT where the anode lead connects, so clean carefully.
Radio Shack used to (I haven't looked lately) sell corona dope,
otherwise you can probably find corona dope at a local TV repair
supply shop.  If you don't know how to discharge the anode lead,
don't mess with the high voltage wiring.

On TVI 950s, a video board that was about to blow would sometimes
overload the low voltage board and cause false symptoms to appear on
the logic board.

We still have several of these terminals that work pretty well. Assuming
you really have a 910+, here are the settings (I think the
baud/parity/stop bit switches are the same on the 910, but most others
are different):

Switch settings are:

Hello everyone on the Net, I am looking for someone that has a Televideo
955 terminal that supports WordStar mode. I have a 905, that does
support WordStar mode, curiousley enough the 955 doesn't.

Please let me know what revision of firmware you have (you can tell it
by bringing up the self test mode by entering setup mode and pressing
the numeral "1" next to the Escape key... the revision will appear in
the lower left corner of the screen).

Please also reply by E-Mail, since the bandwidth utilisation might not
be appreciated.

Thanks!!

Blair.

You can get a manual for the Televideo model 950 terminal from Sharon
Industries in San Jose, California. They have complete units, parts and
manuals for all Televideo terminals and CP/M systems. Their phone number
is (408)-456-1600. You can also call up my BBS, (Televideo Station), at
(416)-507-9608, at speeds up to 2400 baud, n81, and download the files
TV950MAN.DOC and TV950.DOC, which contain respectively the escape and
control codes for the 950, and the DIP switch settings.

Televideo is still in business too, by the way.

  Contrary to everybody's hoping :-), Televideo is still in bussiness. You can
call them and ask for the settings (or other technical assistance).  Try this 
number:	1-800-835-3228.  If you just need the setup, an assistant will take
your name and number and mail or fax you a copy right away.  Apparently, many
people ask for those. If you need to write them, here is the address

	Televideo Systems, Inc. 
	550 East Brokaw Road.
	POB 49048
	San Jose, California 95161-9048
 
   Their fax number:  408-954-0622.

	[try voice at +1 408-954-8333]
 
   Disclaimer:  The above information is accurate as of 6/9/92. I am not 
responsible if TVI went of bussiness after that.    *-*-)

Televideo used mostly the same power supply modules, video driver
modules and picture tubes in the following models: 910, 910+, 912, 912C,
920, 925 and 950 as well as the TS-800A CP/M workstation. The only major
differences between these was the case styles (some clamshell, others
with detached keyboard)... the logic and keyboards gave each their
specific personalities.

Parts for the above can of course be commonly interchanged
(cannibalised), or if you prefer, there is a company in San Jose
California that has lots of spare parts, manuals, and even whole new and
used units... Sharon Industries... (408)-436-0455.

I actually have one of these beasts, and I can tell you that it was
intended to be connected to one of Televideo's Personal Mini file
servers, such as the PM/4 or PM/16 or similar. I don't however have any
of the documentation on this computer, but I think that it can be
obtained from Sharon Industries in San Jose, California. Call them at
(408)-436-0455--and give them a try, since they specialize in
discontinued Televideo hardware.

Try telling the terminal ESC-M (local escape capital M).  That is
the way to get the identification string on a 950 or 955.

The keyboard label is correct. This is a TS-800A, which is diskless CP/M
workstation. The TS-800A is basically a model 950 terminal with a Z-80
computer added to the circuit board, that boots off a Televideo CP/M
file server connected to the (15 pin) RS-422 port. Televideo also added
a function that allows the integral terminal to be used without the
computer portion, by flipping a dipswitch and setting up the baud rate
and other comms parameters. You can obtain manuals from Sharon
Industries in San Jose California, at (408)-436-0455 for a nominal fee.

1: The keyclick can be turned off by using the keyboard command SHIFT-ESC <

position 1 up.

2: You can set the comm port for 9600 by setting switch S1 position 1,2,3,4

Inside the 970 is a set of DIP switches.  One of them will control 
the mode the terminal boots into, another i believe will affect whether
the setup information can be changed.  If the the terminal does not
boot into the diagnostic screen the switches have probably been toyed
with.  I wish i could tell you which switch did what, but i had to use
a hit-or-moreoften-miss strategy myself, since sharon industries could
offer no information about the 970.  

Once you can enter the setup screen, the cursor keys select the option,
the t key changes them (toggle, i assume), ctrl-r resets to default,
and ctrl-s saves thems to nvram.

The terminal does ansi, vt52, and and tek (4014?) graphics.  I owned
one for years and my only complaints were the lack of docs and the 
weight of the keyboard.  I think it made out of a lead and pig iron alloy. ;)

According to my copy of the _Televideo Operator's Manual, Model 950_:

The DIP switch set on the RIGHT of the terminal (looking at the back
of the cabinet) controls the baud rates for the terminal and its
serial printer.  It's marked S1 (BAUD RATE)

Table follows:

             _____________________
             | | | | | | | | | | |  UP (1)
             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+             DIP switch on the RIGHT

               0 1 0 1   | 150
               0 1 1 0   | 300
               0 1 1 1   | 600
               1 0 0 0   | 1200
               1 0 0 1   | 1800
               1 0 1 0   | 2400
               1 0 1 1   | 3600
               1 1 0 0   | 4800
               1 1 0 1   | 7200
               1 1 1 0   | 9600
               1 1 1 1   | 19200

Switches not for baud rate setting:

   Switch 6 is for stop bits:  up = 2 stop bits, down = 1
   Switch 5 is for word length:  up = 7 data bits, down = 8

Hope this helps.

The first thing that I am doing with any new (old) piece of equipment is to
open the back panel and see what is inside   8-)

One of my reasons to call this thing "beast" was the fact that there are no DS
inside!

By try-and-error in the Set Up menu (called by Shift-SET UP|NO SCROLL)
I have found that Ctrl-D restore to default (?) while Ctrl-R is just jumping to
the upper-left corner (after save with Ctrl-S); Ctrl-Tab is starting the tab 
setup; and Ctrl-C is allowing modification in the INS CHAR (?); Unfortunately I
miss in those experiments the single T key for toggle (space bar is not working
for SETUP options change), but in this menu I don't see any options for the
terminal emulation mode (VT100, TEK1014 etc.)

is "diagnostic screen" = "setup screen"?

X-Date: 27 February A.D. 1995

Some persons have inquired about where to purchase used Televideo 955 terminals.

I know of two vendors:

    Regal Computer Solutions, Inc.
    23362 Madero Rd., Suite F
    Mission Viejo, California 92691
    voice: +1 714/457-0865
      fax: +1 714/457-9627
      web: http://www.regaltechnology.com/


    Computer Hardware Resources, Inc.
    Houston, Texas
    WATS voice:  1-800/410-6161
    POTS voice: +1 713/683-8977

These firms may also offer refurbished Stratus V102 terminals for
sale.  These are just Televideo 955s with "Stratus" branded on them
and equipped with the 2-page-memory option. 

Computer Hardware Resources, Inc. also sells refurbished DEC and 
Wyse terminals and dot-matrix printers and will repair most brands
of terminals for a flat rate of $79.00 (US).

 \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

And yet another dealer in used computer equipment:

    Lighthouse Computer Systems Inc.
    5912 Kellogg Avenue
    Cincinnati, Ohio 45228
    voice: +1 513/232-9844
      fax: +1 513/232-9845

I wouldn't use emulations if I were you.  I'd use the native mode of
each terminal.  This does mean creating or coming up with 4 terminal
types instead of 1, but you're more likely to take advantage of each
terminal if you use what each offers instead of using a common
denominator.  Further, if the glitch is defined in the termcap or
terminfo entry for that terminal, and the program you use is still
drawing things incorrectly, it is that _program_ that is broken not
the terminal or the termcap/terminfo entry.  Unfortunately, it's quite
common for Unix programs to work only with terminals that have no
magic cookies or (even worse) to work best only with something that is
vt100-compatible.

If you do turn off the features, you'll have a broken termcap/terminfo
definition.  I think you set xmc#1 and write to the program authors
telling them their software is broken.

>I'd like to see a workable terminfo or termcap if possible.

I doubt you'll ever find a complete termcap definition for any but the
least capable terminal.  GNU termcap entries could be complete, but
most termcap entries are written for BSD termcap and since BSD hasn't
updated the (now silly) limit on overall termcap size, this means some
capabilities get left out.  I've included a starter wyse50 entry that
should be useful but extended.

Most vendors don't bundle 100% operable entries.  Most vendors just
take the broken or half-baked entries and ship them.  I'm working on
building a 100% complete database of entries, but they'll have to be
terminfo only (converted to GNU termcap only).

You should consult the terminal manual to see if a given terminal
really has automargins and then verify that on the actual terminal.
If something displays wrong, again, you might have broken Unix apps.

For various tests and invaluable info regarding creating your own 100%
complete entries, I urge you to buy "termcap & terminfo" from O'Reilly
books.  It's an excellent resource for everyone reading this
newsgroup.

I found the answer to my question under the IBM 3270/950 emulation list of
transmitted codes in the Procomm Plus manual.  I use the Televideo 955
emulation to call an AS/400 system.  When I accidentally type a character
into a protected field, the AS/400 stops responding to any more keystrokes
until you send it the equivalent of the reset key on some terminals.  I
found out that I have to press CTRL R to clear the keyboard lockout and
allow me to type again.

I'm not sure whether I understand you fully. The RESET key doesn't send an
escape sequence to the host, but resets the terminal when pressed with CTRL.
Are you asking for a command to do the same?  There are

ESC ~ 0 	Reset terminal to factory values.
ESC ~ 1 	Reset terminal to NV-RAM values. (Same as CTRL RESET.)
ESC ~ 2 	Reset function keys to factory values.
ESC ~ 3 	Reset editing keys to factory values.

The (shifted) function keys don't send any particular escape sequences, but
those they were set to. Are you asking for the commands to program them or
for the factory values? The latter are

SOH ` CR	Shifted F1
  thru
SOH o CR	Shifted F16

Thanks. Unfortunately, I've got this problem because we've got hordes of old 
Televideos which are being used for public displays (because nobody would want 
to steal them). And so...

I'm making progress: I've fixed the problem with the box characters by 
redefining the terminfo entry to use normal (+-|) characters, and I've managed 
to get the standout code working by descending to generating the character 
sequences from terminfo information, and not using curses at all for that bit.

But there's got to be a better solution... Hasn't there?

Message-ID: <199508252124.RAA05971@duncan.cs.utk.edu>
Subject:  ProComm

With regard to the recent substantive discussion of terminal emulation
for V102s and V103s:

ProComm is an attractive terminal-emulation product.  However, its
Televideo emulation mode has one deficiency of importance when it is
asked to replace a Stratus terminal: it does not support the second
page of screen memory.

The Stratus V102 terminal, as we have discussed here before, is
basically a Televideo 955, but all 955's in V102 livery are equipped
with the second page of screen memory. (The 2nd page was an extra-cost
option for the stock Televideo product.)

The screen memory commands are documented on page 22 of the
"Stratus V102 Terminal Programmer's Guide" (R103) where "Escape" is
the single ASCII code 0x1B:

  Display page 0      Escape [ 1 ; 0 }
  Display page 1      Escape [ 1 ; 1 }
  Display other page  Escape K                   (or  Escape J)

The standard VOS 'v102' terminal-type definition (.ttp) setup assumes
that the second page is there.

The explanation given in R103:

    Page 0 is generally used for the text that is displayed on the
    screen.  Page 1 is used to store data that is being held for
    later and perhaps repetitive display on the screen.  For exam-
    ple, the Word Processing Editor's menu is stored in the second
    page of memory (page 1).  When [MENU] requests are issued, the
    Word Processing Editor simply causes the terminal to display
    the second page and thus does not have to retransmit the entire
    screen.

So, if the second page is not there, some operations with some VOS
applications produce strange or no output.

One of my colleagues asked DataStorm Technologies (ProComm's vendor)
about the possibility of a new version that would support the second
screen page, and he received no encouragement.

But if you want to use the tvi955.ttp from "unsupported_ttps", then
maybe you'll be happy with ProComm.  But if you are going to use a
non-Stratus terminal type, then you could just as well use the
ANSI-type DEC VT100 or VT220 flavor performed by many other terminal-
emulator software products.

Frans,
 
I appreciate your reply.  However, we have tested Procomm Plus
a couple of times in the past and found their TV 955 emulation
to be woefully incomplete.  Have you in fact used it?  Has it
been substantially improved?  Does it now include things like
line lock and upper/lower message lines?

P.S.  In doing this research, so far the most complete product

has hooks to allow a Visual Basic program to look at the data
stream.

The upgrades came with a new nameplate sticker that said 910+.

If you do ESC V in local mode, or with pins 2 and 3 connected,
most of the TVI terminals would show you the modem number and
prom version, but not the 910/910+. You should be able to figure
it out from the S2 4 and 5 settings, since the 910+ will not
do an underline cursor, but the 910 did.

The upgrade changed the way the terminal worked (dropped all of
the emulations, may have fixed some mistakes in the ESC sequences);
the DIP switch settings I posted show you what changed from a users
point of view.

This terminal is supposed to emulate the VT-100. If you need more specific
info, there is a company in San Jose Ca., that supports old TeleVideo gear, but
I can't remember the name. Do a text search to the last month or two worth of
mesages in this newsgroup for TeleVideo, or try calling TeleVideo themselves

This device is a diskless XT that connects over RS-422 to a TeleVideo Personal
Mini, which runs either InfoShare or an early version of Novell's Netware. With
that connected, it boots DOS from the server, and gains a session to the file
server, and presents a login prompt. It's based on the same basic platform as
TeleVideo's 905 and 955 terminals, so the monitor/power supply/case could
probably be retrofitted with a 905/955 logic board and keyboard, which would
give you a much better (and more configurable) terminal emulation.

Televideo 950s are approximately 1979 technology, built to communicate
over asynchronous serial lines.  My [former] employer, Stratus Computer,
used to sell them (as model V101).  Stratus stopped selling them around
1990 and dropped support for them in 1995.  And Stratus is better than
most vendors about supporting such older products.

In case you haven't been following the chronology, in 1979 TCP/IP was
still merely a figment of some researchers' imaginations.  By the time
TCP/IP was in use anywhere, the ANSI standard for terminal controls
was well established (by the success of the DEC VT100) and Televideo's
proprietary control sequences were on the downslope of popularity.

I'm sure if you threw enough money at somebody, then such a thing could
be cobbled together.  Maybe a remote applet that runs on either an X
Terminal or a "Net Computer".

In 1990, IXI had a product called "X.deskterm", a package for
integrating character-based applications into an X Windows environment.
It included a number of terminal-emulation modules.  There's a good
chance that TVI 955 was among them.  The old phone number used to be
+44 (0223) 462131.  I think IXI was bought by Visionware, which was
itself later gobbled up by SCO.

The question is, how much money are you willing to throw? Or what level
of support do you require?  You are asking to have somebody cobble
together a variation on some old proprietary technology, where newer,
standards-based technology that does more-or-less the same job exists.
There's not a big market for it.

Has the V102 been known to communicate normally through that serial
port?  It may need a null-modem cable or adapter, since both the
video terminal and the computer have DTE-flavor serial ports.

On a Sun SPARC machine, when used with a serial-terminal console
instead of a graphics "head", a serial "break" condition is used
to revert control from the operating system to the OpenBoot PROM
monitor.  (Don't do this unless you mean it!)  If the machine is
being operated with a graphics head and a local Type-5 keyboard,   
the keychord Stop-A has the same effect (L1-A on older machines).

A real Stratus V102 terminal (a.k.a. Televideo 955) should be able
to transmit a serial-line "break" condition.  The V102's second
keyboard-setup menu (accessed using Shift-SETUP) does have a
modifier for the BREAK key. The two effects of that menu setting:

  "BRK EN"   pressing just the BREAK key sends the break

  "BRK DIS"  you have to type the keychord CTRL-BREAK   

On the other hand, you didn't describe the configuration of your
"Sun box". Its default setting might have been changed to ignore
the regular "break" signal. The "Alternate Break" sequence,
possible in Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, and (soon) Solaris 9, is

    CR  ~  CTRL-B
  
That's Carriage Return, tilde, Control-B, with at least one-half
second elapsing between characters, and with the sequence being
completed within 5 seconds.  You can read about this in the
Solaris man-page help system with these commands:

    % man kbd
    % man zs

From the keyboard, I'd say it was a Televideo 912B, although my manuals 
don't show any model which only got two lighter keys on it. The Return key 
changed into the mirrored 'L' shape for later models.

There is a posting on Shuford's site from Mark Aitchison which lists the 
different escape sequences for quite a few of the Televideo models. If you 
get really enthusiastic, you could try making your way down that list, 
trying the sequences in local mode.

If it does turn out to be a TVI-912, you can grab the manual from

HELP TVI                                           Aaron Sloman June 1982

--- TEMPORARY DOCUMENTATION ON TELEVIDEO VERSION OF VED --------------

There are two library files for Televideo terminals (unsupported).
LIB * TVI is for model TVI 920C, emulating a VT52 VDU.

LIB * TVI925 is for the TVI 925 VDU. For details on the latter do

    SHOWLIB * TVI925

To load it do

    lib tvi925;

The rest of this file is concerned with LIB TVI.

To use the TVI 920C version of VED it is necessary to do

    lib tvi;

before you run VED. This takes a few seconds, but you can, instead,
create a saved image to avoid frequent re-compilation.

Use down arrow key to read on.

LIB TVI caused real problems because the terminals don't correspond to
the manual.  I assume this is because of VT52 emulation.

Note: If you use the full power of the Televideo terminal, which
includes the ability to insert and delete lines (used for scrolling this
window) you will find a terrible screen flicker. It seems to have an
inherent design fault. You can overcome this by the following:

    true -> vednolineinsert;

(which can go into your vedinit.p file if you use the Televideo often).
The result will be re-writing of the whole window every time you need to
scroll it up or down.

-- KEYS ON THE TELEVIDEO -----------------------------------------------

The following assumes twelve function keys, F1 to F12, which transmit

    ESC ? CHAR.

Then there are 4 more keys marked

    Char Insert, Char delete, Line insert, Line Delete.

Above the keypad are three more keys, one simulating GOLD (ESC P) and
the other two duplicating Char Insert, and Line Delete. !!!

The four Arrow function keys work as on the Visual 200, and are left for
large moves up, down, left, right, as with the Visual 200 version.

The general plan is as follows

    Keys F1 to F11 work exactly as on V200.
    F12  = VEDEXCHANGEPOSITION (ESC P on V200)
    So:

    F1  = Delete line to left of cursor
    F2  = Delete whole of cursor line
    F3  = delete line to right of cursor
    F4  = Delete word to left of cursor
    F5  = Delete word to right of cursor
    F6  = Move in or out of static mode
    F7  = Mark as beginning of range
    F8  = Mark as end of range
    F9  = Move marked range to after cursor line
    F10 = Push current position onto VEDPOSITIONSTACK
    F11 = POP top of VEDPOSITIONSTACK - i.e. go back to that position
    F12 = Exchange current position with top of position stack.

    CHAR INSERT key  = insert line above
    CHAR DELETE key  = delete char under cursor  (like CTRL-P)
    LINE INSERT key  = insert line below
    LINE DELETE key  = line delete (as does F2)

    The key with blue dot, above keypad 7 does screen refresh
    The next two keys duplicate the CHAR INSERT and LINE DELETE KEYS.

Holding the FUNCT button down changes all keys so that they transmit
CTRL-A, then the normal character (controlled by shift) then CR

This means that CTRL-A can no longer be used for VEDSCREENLEFT However,
VEDREADFUNCTIONKEY has been defined so that three CTRL-A's in succession
will do screen left!

The FUNC key has been used to modify the keypad, so that the numbers 1
to 9 with FUNC key depressed work exactly as on V200. I.e. the move
cursor in 8 directions.

For bigger jumps do ESC then key. E.g. ESC 9 does VEDCHARUPLOTS, and ESC
3 does VEDCHARDOWNRIGHTLOTS.

The Comma and Dot, with FUNC do word left or word right.

Instead of ENTER it is necessary to press FUNC and RETURN,
    or FUNC and ENTER
    (The rather silly ENTER key on the Televideo just duplicates RETURN!)

    FUNC a  = go to top of file
    FUNC z  = go to end of file
    FUNC g  = REDO last command.
    FUNC -  = REDO last command. (I.e. use key next to ENTER key)
    FUNC 0  = put cursor back on command line without removing previous
                command

To extend the range of function facilities, copy [pop.lbi.ved]tvi.p, and
edit VEDREADFUNCTIONKEY to suit yourself.  The system version may be
extended if there are good suggestions.
