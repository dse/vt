The latter is just 'Xvnc' for which there are several ports (Linux, Solaris, etc).
If you don't have a Unix host handy, it's easy to install VMware with a Linux
instance on the win32 machhine.  At that point, you almost don't need
an X client on the win32 machine, because the X server in the Linux VMware instance
will do the work for you.  You will probably get better performance since the Linux
instance can DMA the display to the win32 master, after you've installed VMware
tools.

My approach is: install Windows XP on the machine, then run a Linux VMware instance.
This is because (IMHO) the Windows XP desktop is superior to the Linux desktop,
and some of the programs that I run are Windows only and use the graphics
hardware w/ OpenGL or DirectX.  This is a 'best of both worlds' because you
have a nice, stable Linux box in which you can get all your real work done,
and a 'pretty face' Windows desktop.

I've also done the opposite (Linux host w/ Windows VMware guest).

I've used commercial (exceed) and free (cygwin) X servers for win32 and they get
the job done.
