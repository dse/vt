The VT510 and VT520 monochrome text terminals and VT525 color text
terminal emulate a number of ANSI and ASCII terminals.  The
termcap/terminfo data provided is for ANSI emulations only.
ASCII emulations use existing termcap/terminfo entries.

This software is free to copy without restriction.  This software is
supplied "as is".  The information in this software is subject to
change without notice and should not be construed as a commitment by
Digital Equipment Corporation.

This termcap and terminfo data has been developed on a SCO UNIX system,
but has been reported to work on other UNIX systems.  Some modifications
may be necessary.

Data files:
 vt525.tc = termcap data,  "/etc/termcap"
 vt525.ti = terminfo data, "/usr/lib/terminfo"

Example installation on a SCO UNIX system.  The example assumes that
the data is supplied on a DOS formatted diskette.
From the root account:
For termcap:
 - preserve your current termcap data by:
   "cp /etc/termcap /etc/termcap.old"
 - copy data from diskette to "/etc" directory by: (DOS to UNIX copy)
   "doscp a:vt525.tc /etc/termcap"  
 - append old termcap data to new termcap data
   "cat /etc/termcap.old >> /etc/termcap"
   or paste the new data into "/etc/termcap" using an editor.
   Hint: termcap data is searched sequentially.
   Place most often used entries at the beginning of the file.

For terminfo:
 - copy data from diskette to "/usr/lib/terminfo" directory by:
   "doscp a:vt525.ti /usr/lib/terminfo/vt525.ti"
 - "cd /usr/lib/terminfo", then compile the terminfo data by:
   "tic -v vt525.ti"

To use:
 - Log in
 - Define the TERM environment variable: "TERM=vt525"

VT525 Termcap/terminfo entries are: vt525, vt525nam
   Use 'ansi' or 'ansic' with SCO Console emulation.

   Color capabilities are not standardized among UNIX systems
   and are therefore not included in this termcap/terminfo data.

  may be useful for development and debugging.

  the VT520 and VT525 terminals.
